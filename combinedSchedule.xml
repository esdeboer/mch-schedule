                <abstract>⚠️ Warning! This talk may contain hackers. There may be hackers in the room. There may be hackers surrounding the room. There may be hackers recording this. There may be hackers listening in. There may be hackers that exfiltrate data. There may be hackers wearing shirts. There may be hackers carrying spying devices. OH NO! There are hackers EVERYWHERE! What can we do now, except having a party?</abstract>
                <description>This talk serves as an introduction to the camp. It tells how the camp works, what new features are being released, how to participate and what to be aware of.

During this talk there will be some audio-trickery in the Abacus stage which can not be relayed to the recording or via the stream. As we cannot film audience reactions, know that it will be more epic than the final battle scene of LOTR.

In all seriousness: there are absolutely stunning new additions to the camp.

                <abstract>What do big tech, synthesizers, the crucifixion and Matthäus Passion have in common? Find the answer in the tech performance The Silicon Passion. We’ve all embraced big tech —but is it a warm hug or a strangulation? Bear witness to a debate of biblical proportions between tech nerds, technology and its users. In The Silicon Passion SETUP, in collaboration with de Transmissie (David Schwarz en Derk Stenvers) and Rodrigo Ferreira, is looking for a way out of the pit that technology has created for them.</abstract>
                <description>The performers draw inspiration from one of the most important stories about penance: the crucifixion. They want to find out exactly who or what should be nailed to the cross, and what the world might look like after a resurrection.Taking the St Matthew Passion as a starting point, both for the valuable lessons as well as musical inspiration. Armed with Bachst’ St Matthew Passion and synthesizers we will look for a new way of dealing with big tech.

SETUP (Utrecht) is a media lab exploring the day-to-day future of technology. Using a critical yet humorous perspective, SETUP translates complex themes into more tangible ideas for everyone. In 2021, SETUP asked several artists to offer new perspectives on penance and forgiveness for big tech, using the St Matthew Passion. A composed group consisting of multidisciplinary theater collective de Transmissie and musician Rodrigo Ferreira came to a stunning result, with live performances from Theater Kikker and Pakhuis de Zwijger in April 2021. The new performance in 2022 is the next step in this research.</description>

                <abstract>This is a submission for a keynote talk at MCH2022. The Internet is both a familiar, comfortable place as well as a bottomless rabbit hole you can lose yourself in. The Internet has always been like this from its inception, the difference now is the scale and consequences are almost immeasurable - and it tests the limits of human imagination. When you look into the mirror of the Internet what you see reflected back depends on what you are looking for. It has become largely a reflection of yourself.</abstract>

                <abstract>Building on the very well attended DNA presentations ("DNA: The Code Of Life") at SHA2017, this talk will cover:

 * A brief recap what DNA is and how it works
   * It is surprisingly digital!
 * How reading DNA is within 'pro-sumer' reach now
   * (I might bring a live demo for after the talk)
 * An overview of DNA editing technologies (offline, and online: on living organisms)
    * Including the famous CRISPR-CAS, but also newer variants
 * How does such editing actually work in a lab?
 * The surprising lack of a definitive link between most DNA mutations and any effect
 * Could you hack your DNA? Will people start doing this?
   * Should we try to stop them?
 * Wild speculation on what this might mean for the future

The goal of this presentation is to provide real non-hyped information on what DNA editing is and what it might achieve. And since we are hackers, I hope to explain how a hackerspace could start reading DNA right now with USB-powered hardware. And finally, since no hacker can resist tinkering: could you hack your own genome, or your cat's, or improve on your favorite plant?</abstract>

                <abstract>Most security implementations leak information, mechanical security is no different. It takes sharp eyes, a soft touch, and a good hearing to distinguish between information and noise. In this talk we will go in depth on how locks works, and how we can persuade them to disclose their secrets, and open them without damage.</abstract>
                <description>The Open Organization of Lockpickers (Toool) is a group of nerds obsessed with mechanical security. We create, collect, take apart, discuss, and attempt to defeat locks. While we are known for lockpicking, there are many other techniques for opening locks without damage. 

This talk will focus on the language of the locks, the side channels in mechanical security systems. We will start with binding order, the mechanism to isolate the locking elements, and exploit them one by one. Then we will discuss a wide variety of other methods of gathering information and opening locks. Most of these methods are not practical, but working them out gives us great joy, and we would like to share the highlights with you.</description>

                <abstract>The sound system in the Abacus stage is promoted by HOLOPLOT as 'a new era of audio'. The system, called X1, allows for horizontal and vertical directional audio control, which opens up the door for lots of new creative possibilities. Everything from defying the conventional behaviour of sound such as mitigating reflection and reverberation - to dividing a space into virtual zones each with unique audio content, all from a single sound system. Imagine the left-hand side of a room listening to a conference in French and the right-hand side in Japanese. Each side is unaware of the other.

During this session engineers from HOLOPLOT will collaborate with a bunch of DJs and musicians (which might include you) and take the chance to unleash some creativity in the tent! A mini-mission to find out what this new era of audio really means! This is an experimental session that features a wide selection of audio: various styles of music, sound effects and field recordings. You might be dancing to live mashups, where the vocals of the left and right sides of the room differ,  you might find yourself standing in the middle of Times Square.

When attending this session it will be rewarding to walk around in the tent, as different parts of the tent can contain different soundscapes and experiments. Join this session to see what the possibilities are for this technology as we push to discover its potential and its limitations!

If you want to play something on stage, be there at 22:30 during the session buildup.</abstract>

                <abstract>Have you ever forgotten a passphrase or lost a hardware token? Lost access to enough Bitcoin to buy a pizza or two? Encryption is fundamental to securing our liberties, but key and password management remain difficult even for professionals, let alone the general public.

This talk presents Passcrow, an Open Source project attempting to address one of crypto's largest usability issues: password and key recovery in a decentralized environment.</abstract>
                <description>Passcrow is a system for community-assisted secure “password escrow”, making it possible to recover from forgetting or losing a key, password or passphrase. Born out of a desire to make strong encryption easier (and safer!) to use for less technical users, the project is in an early stage of development - but code has been published and the system is usable today.

Passcrow is many things: there is an underlying protocol, basic user experience guidelines, a client library for integration with other (Python) apps, an HTTP API server, and a command-line tool for making use of the system by hand. Potential applications include password managers, secure messengers, general purpose encryption tools (including OpenPGP and hard drive encryption) and cryptocurrency wallets.

In this talk, I will discuss the motivation and rationale for the project, demonstrate how the system works and talk about some of the challenges and design decisions we have seen so far.

The purpose of this talk is to solicit feedback and participation from the community; if you are interested in the subject, please come find me afterwards (my base at MCH will be The Quarantine Arms village) and let's have a chat! If you miss the talk, you can read about it at www.passcrow.org.

Passcrow is a spin-off from Mailpile (www.mailpile.is), the secure e-mail client. Passcrow is inspired by Mailpile's experience attempting to make e-mail encryption more usable for less technical users, and will be used in future versions of the app.</description>

                <abstract>Thanks to DNSSEC and DANE, it is possible to automatically verify user@domain.name identities by checking with domain.name servers.  The real problem however, is integration with existing protocols, instead of inventing something completely new and perhaps web-only.  The purpose of our work on Realm Crossover mechanisms has been to design generic solutions that extend many different application protocols, without changing their protocol specs.</abstract>
                <description>For clients, being able to control an online identity is not just a cool matter of adding their domain name at the end.  It also means that they control how long the identity exists, if it is an alias, if it can be a group account with members that they control.  (We made identity and access control libraries to support all that, along with identities that are only usable until a timeout, from a certain remote domain, under a particular communication topic, and so on.)

For servers, being able to authenticate users from any domain is an answer to many questions that otherwise stagnate:

  * Why does every HTTP server want us to create an account under its domain, instead of letting us use our own?
  * Why do we constantly need to confirm our email address by clicking links?
  * Why not authenticate SMTP senders and subject others to the most stringent spam filtering?
  * Why not publish a mailing list archive in IMAP, available only to subscribers and searchable with their own tooling?
  * Why not use AMQP as an automation-friendly document push protocol with authenticated senders for form submission, bill processing, blog publications, document archiving, ...
  * Why not share your MQTT dataflow with external parties, so they don't need to keep a web page open to be notified about, say, a newly posted document?
  * Why not share your PGP keys and contact information in your own LDAP directory but with access control to decide who may see what?

All these questions stagnate on problems like *You would need to have accounts for all users in the World*.  So that is what we solved in this project.

This project expands the usefulness of many protocols by changing the way their implementations handle authentication; instead of local accounts, they follow a backlink to the client's domain.  We designed and built the extensions needed for the backend, and made a few first implementations.  We are hoping to show the usefulness of adopting these ideas in your own tooling.

We present a number of generic mechanisms for Realm Crossover:

 1. SASL tokens can be relayed to a Diameter server under the domain.name;
 2. Kerberos supports Realm Crossover, and a keying handshake can do this on-demand;
 3. X.509 certificates and PGP keys can be assured with DANE-akin structures for clients or by a lookup in an LDAP server for domain.name.

For each, some form of domain-owned identity provider is run to assert identity when an external service needs it.  The level of security is a matter of the user and their domain.name; an external service should not have to force down the security level of the client's domain.

These three Realm Crossover mechanisms cover the majority of application protocols, the notable exceptions being the oldest ones, like Telnet, FTP and HTTP.  Specifically for HTTP, we have defined an authentication mechanism that adds SASL; this means that new security mechanisms can be defined in SASL, where it benefits many protocols; it also means that authentication shifts from the HTTP application to the server, where the coding environment is better suited for such responsibilities.

We end with a demo, showcasing a useful authentication flow:

  * Client desktop, with FireFox and a HTTP-SASL plugin
  * Server domain, running Apache with HTTP-SASL module under an independent domain
  * Server identity client, using Diameter to relay SASL to the Client Domain
  * Client Domain, running an identity provider with SASL over Diameter</description>

                <abstract>In March 2022 the Global NOG Alliance (GNA) started the Keep Ukraine Connected task force to help network operators in Ukraine during and after the invasion. These are our experiences. A simple idea turned into an interesting logistics puzzle with a steep learning curve into customs rules.</abstract>
                <description>What started as a simple idea ("Our goal is to help network operator groups, I'm sure there is more that we can do than hosting their websites and email when there is a war going on) turned into a global aid campaign. We have shipped a truck full of network equipment to Ukraine, and that was only a tiny part. Many companies and individuals from around the world have donated money, hardware and software to help the Ukrainian network operators. Everything from WiFi access points and PoE switches to be used in the bomb shelters to full-rack core routers for rebuilding their infrastructure.

In the end the logistics are the hardest part. Finding warehouses to temporarily store the donated hardware to getting help shipping equipment across borders and through complicated customs rules (network devices are dual-use goods, and convincing customs officers that a truck full of gear qualifies as humanitarian aid can be a challenge…)</description>

                <abstract>Warning (but don't be afraid): this talk contains an overarching theory of the workings of Internet governance (with an emphasis on human rights)! 

The rules of the road for the Internet infrastructure are designed in different governance bodies, such as the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF), the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), and in Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). 

I will showcase how Internet governance institutions are tied together through 'the infrastructural norm of interconnection'. This concept helps explain how Internet governance works and why many social and legal norms, such as human rights and data protection, get resisted and subverted in the governance of the Internet infrastructure.

This talk is the outcome of 6 years participation in and research of Internet governance institutions and processes, and is suitable for both issue matter experts and people who never heard of Internet governance before.</abstract>
                <description>The entanglement of the Internet with the daily practices of governments, companies, institutions, and individuals means that the processes that shape the Internet also shape society. For this talk, I studied the norms that shape the Internet’s underlying structure through its transnational governance. Norms are the ‘widely-accepted and internalised [sic] principles or codes of conduct that indicate what is deemed to be permitted, prohibited, or required of agents within a specific community’ (Erskine and Carr 2016, 87). Internet governance is the development, coordination, and implementation of policies, technologies, protocols, and standards. Internet governance produces a global and interoperable Internet functioning as a general-purpose communication network in transnational governance bodies. I examine four cases of norm conflict and evolution in three key Internet governance institutions: the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF); the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN); and the Réseaux IP Européens Network (RIPE). 

I show how social and legal norms evolve and are introduced, subverted, and resisted by participants in Internet governance processes with distinct and dynamic values and interests, in order to develop policies, technologies, and standards to produce an interconnected Internet. I leverage notions and insights from science and technology studies and international relations to illuminate how a sociotechnical imaginary—the combination of visions, symbols, and futures that exist in groups and society—architectural principles, and an entrenched norm function as instruments of metagovernance in the Internet infrastructure. This way, I demonstrate how a sociotechnical imaginary, values, and norms facilitate, instruct, and evaluate the norm setting processes in Internet governance. 

This talk is empirically grounded in the analysis of mailing lists; technical documents; policy documents; interviews and the extensive observation of governance meetings. I have operationalized this analysis using the following methods: quantitative descriptive analysis; network analysis; quantitative and qualitative discourse analysis, as well as in participant observation, including semi-structured interviews and ethnographic probes.  

The aim of this talk is to show how Internet governance happening in multistakeholder bodies, what I call private Internet governance, solely functions to increase interconnection between independent networks. In this process, the introduction of social and legal norms—such as human rights principles and data protection regulations that might hamper increased interconnection—is resisted by significantly represented stakeholders in the process. Ultimately, I argue that while the sociotechnical imaginary and architectural principles serve to legitimize this governance ordering, the entrenched norm, what I call the infrastructural norm that transcends singular institutions, guides the distributed private governance regime. 

The infrastructural norm of voluntary interconnection plays an instructing and evaluating role in the process of norm development and evolution in private Internet governance. The infrastructural norm is embedded in its institutional configuration, technological materiality, economical incentives, and supranational interest, and ties the private Internet governance regime together. In conclusion, I posit that the private Internet governance regime is designed and optimized for the narrow and limited role of increasing interconnection. As a result, the governance regime resists aligning Internet infrastructure with social or legal norms that might limit or hamper increasing interconnection.</description>

                <abstract>Utilizing collaborative security to collect data on attacks we were able to detect Log4J in a quite unusual but effective manner. We'll show you how CrowdSec enables the entire infosec community to stand together by detecting attempts to exploit a critical 0day, reporting them centrally thereby enabling anyone to protect themselves shortly after the vulnerability was made public. The unusual part is that this is done using FOSS software and by analyzing logs of real production systems but in a way that doesn't compromise the anonymity of anyone (except the attacker, of course) and doing so with a reliable result where poisoning and false positives are almost impossible. Too good to be true? Come by and judge for yourself!</abstract>
                <description>The objective with the talk is to inspire the audience to understand why the world needs to think differently towards the threats of cyberattacks from criminals and which advantages it has when you’re really utilizing the power of the crowd. 

Basically we’ve been doing it wrong until now by thinking that all the world’s problems can be solved by throwing money at them. Guess what: They can’t. Defending against hackers is a full time, complex task that requires a lot of complex tasks to be carried out in the same order and same way every time to be effective. That’s difficult to do so in order to make it more doable we should try working together. CrowdSec is FOSS software that does exactly this by enabling users to share information about current attacks by parsing log files and sharing basic information (anonymously) about the attack (source ip, timestamp, IoC) with the crowd. 

CrowdSec could be perceived as a modern form of Fail2ban, though for Cloud and container-based infrastructure as well and capable of taking way more advanced decisions a lot faster. Mainly, it’s using a decoupled and distributed approach (detect here, remedy there) and an inference engine that leverages leaky buckets, YAML &amp; Grok patterns to identify aggressive behaviors. It acquires signals from various data sources like files, syslogd, journald, AWS Cloudwatch and Kinesis, Docker logs and Windows Event Log, normalizes them, enriches them to apply heuristics and triggers a bouncer to deal with the threat, if need be. Since it’s written in Go, it’s compatible with almost any environment, fast in execution and ressource conservative.

To make sure signals are generally trustworthy we’ve implemented a reputation engine. Not only don’t we want any false positives - we also don’t want data to be poisoned. This is taken care of by a trust-ranking system where we assign a trust to each agent that will grow over time as the agent provides reliable signals. In this process both persistence and consistency is taken into account. In this process both persistence and consistency is taken into account. When an ip is voted for, it needs a certain amount of points based on the trust rank of each agent that has reported the ip. This system makes it expensive to poison collected data. Not only does it take a long time to reach a trust rank that makes any real difference - also diversity of AS NNumbers are being taken into account as well. The outcome of this is a reliable blocklist that’s constantly redistributed to network members in order to achieve a form of digital herd immunity. An ip caught aggressing WordPress sites will quickly be banned by all members who subscribed to the WordPress defense collection.

While CrowdSec is in charge of the detection, the reaction is performed by “bouncers” that aim to be deployable at any level of the applicative / infrastructure stack :
via nftables/iptables/pf based on an IP set 
via nginx/openresty LUA scripting
via a Wordpress plugin
via a general PHP/Python/JS bouncer that works with all applications written in those languages
on Cloudflare or Fastly via our bouncer that integrates with the provider’s API
on AWS WAF via our bouncer that integrates with AWS’ API.
.. or in many other ways. Over time the possibilities will increase as the application design basically supports anything. 

Bouncers can enforce several types of remediations, like blocking, sending a captcha, notifying, lowering rights, speed, sending a 2FA request, etc.

This approach, combined with a declarative configuration and a stateless behavior, makes it an efficient tool to enhance the security of modern stacks (containers, k8s, serverless and more generally automatically deployed infrastructures).

We are committed to building a strong community, with all that it implies :
a public hub to find, share and amend parsers, scenarios, and blockers
permissive open-source license (MIT) to stay business-friendly
and overall a strong commitment to transparency and community-first mentality, by tooling and behavior

In my talk I will dig into the technical nitty-gritty part of CrowdSec, the architecture and concepts and focus specifically on how we managed to collect data from live Log4J exploitation attempts using the crowd and how efficient this strategy turned out to be. CrowdSec is still collecting data and tracking the result on https://crowdsec.net/log4j-tracker/

The bigger the CrowdSec community becomes, the better protection against cyber criminals. So I really want to inspire the audience to engage in CrowdSec either by installing and using the software, to contribute documentation or code - or all of them. For the good of everybody!

Currently CrowdSec is collecting data from more than 45.000 agents in 158 countries. Each day more than 3M signals are collected. Over the last more than a year over 2.4M malevolent ips have been detected and verified.</description>

                <abstract>A multi-disciplinary lecture and follow up discussion about sustainability from the hacker perspective. It will combine the state of the art scientific knowledge and evidence with observations on the cultural dynamics of the hacker community.  It is the continuation of the series  started at OHM 2013, SH2017, Balccon 2019 and Bornhack 2019</abstract>
                <description>Climate change, habitat and biodiversity loss, environmental pollution and other consequences of the current globalized society are here to stay and will get  worse in the near future. In this talk, we will explore the known, expected and  possible technical, environmental, social, economic and political changes that we will be facing in the next decades. This talk will approach the problem from the hacker / maker perspective. What can and will the impacts be on technology, privacy,  communication, openness, communities and most important of all, Aliexpress shipments? What can we, as the hacker community,  do to prepare ourselves and the communities around us to be robust and resilient to those changes? What can we do to reverse the course of these changes? Do not expect a prepper talk (okay, just a tiny bit),  but rather a discussion based on empirical observations and  scientific insights from a wide variety of academic disciplines. After the lecture a informal discussion session will be organized.</description>

                <abstract>A number of people have built wonderful and useful tools to make the life of KiCad users easier. cpresser and Kliment are here to give you a tour of a number of the most useful addons, and show you what they're good for and how they can improve your life.</abstract>
                <description>We will go through a number of tools that people have built into the KiCad ecosystem - you may have used some of them, but a surprising number of KiCad users aren't aware they exist. We're here to fix that. We'll show you how to make your boards have fancy labels, how to get an interactive assembly guide for your designs, how to easily pack a bunch of boards in a production panel, how to automatically generate footprints, how to make your PCBs fit the real world, how to not repeat your effort when making lots of the same circuit, and how to not make terrible mistakes and lose your work. It will be a wild tour, but you'll have much more fun with your PCB design work afterwards.</description>

                <abstract>As a technical person, you work with complicated and often important matters. Public speaking is essential to get your message across, be heard, and be valued. In this workshop, you will improve your public speaking skills. The workshop is based on the methods of Toastmasters International.

#Training</abstract>
                <description>Rerun of https://program.sha2017.org/events/91.html, which was well received and people asked for it to be done again.

This is a session with a fixed starting time, it is not a walk-in workshop. Please be in time, though you can leave early, should you so desire.

As a technical person, you work with complicated and often important matters. To explain these, get your message across, raise your value and get a better job, it is essential that you can communicate your message to a wider audience. If you cannot effectively explain your solution or your issues to other people you will end up frustrated and unrecognized. Even for educating and training your peers, public speaking skills are very important.

In this workshop, you will improve your public speaking skills. We will practice and evaluate and practice some more.

Your workshop leader is a professional trainer and an advanced member of Toastmasters International. Toastmasters International is a nonprofit educational organization for the purpose of helping members improve their communication skills. More than 300.000 members are organized in around 15.000 member clubs globally.</description>

                <description>Work in teams to assemble all the parts of the PolyCoin crypto miner units together in to a complete unit and then deploy it within MCH.  This will include surface mount soldering, through hole soldering, cutting, laminating, using programming software, to fully assemble and build a working unit.

Each team will be responsible for producing one unit, I'll bring enough to make at least 4 units (I'll try for more if I can).  Some parts will be pre-made due to time constraints (e.g. 3D printed case) but the process to design and print them will be covered.

Skills that will be covered are surface mount soldering of the main PCB, normal through hole soldering of certain parts including the use of flux, rework hot-air to fix issues, connector crimping, programming of software in to the various components, and how the units are put on-line and in to the game.</description>

                <abstract>A workshop format interactive lecture to tackle subjects of mental health and h/activism. A conversation about on/offline identity, isolation, burnout, depression, and social anxieties while trying to connect to those around us to fulfill the desire of "belonging".</abstract>
                <description>Dear all,

My name is Sonia and I am writing with a proposal for a “lecture” regarding mental health in activism called “CyberWell”. 

A little about me: allegedly was at some corners of irc, did “mail to jail” project which focused on sending postcards, mail, and books to imprisoned hacktivists. Did work with refugee women as well as work-related to women's rights on/offline and Laury Love case Naomi Colvin. 

Currently, I work as a psychotherapist. My work is focused on social media's influence on the “creation of opinion” related to various topics such as self-worth, politics, activism, and isolation (to name a few). The struggle to keep afloat while suffering burnout and identity crisis. How we perceive interactions inside our algorithmically generated bubbles and struggle to find the right tool to bypass those on the right-wing “Trump” train while seeking authenticity.

After many years of alleged activism, I myself went through a massive 2-year depression, the road out of which was quite a turmoil. I have seen similar situations happen to my dearest friends many of whom left IT altogether or disassociated completely with their online personas and communities. Some we just sadly lost along the way… Perhaps you reading this, can relate.

I feel that this area of Hacktivism is not spoken about often and wish to share my story, observations, and some tools for those who might relate to the subject matter. It could be a lecture or a workshop depending on the availability of space and time that could be allocated.

It would be grand if it could be a “lecture” the second part of which could be a discussion, which is a format I did at CCC on a similar subject matter but more oriented toward “politics”.

I appreciate your time and effort to create this event and keep us all connected.

With gratitude,
Sonia</description>

                <abstract>Help protect deep brain implants from malicious attacks! Following a case in our own hospital of a patient with a malfunctioning Deep Brain Stimulator (DBS), we want to improve our understanding of these technologies and their susceptibility to malicious hacks. This workshop will describe the medical case of a patient with a failing DBS, we will present the DBS system and we will ask you to hack into it! Help us improve patient neurosecruity by suggesting possible exploits and vulnerabilities.</abstract>
                <description>The security of telemetric medical devices is critical to good patient care [3]. Recent research has described security breaches of implanted medical devices in the context of diabetes (insulin pumps) and cardiology (cardiac defibrillators), however this has not been described in the field of neurology [1-2]. In our workshop we discuss the security vulnerabilities of ‘Deep Brain Stimulator’ (DBS) devices that are currently used in healthcare practice for a range of medical conditions.

Our work revolves around a recent clinical case that we encountered in our hospital. A patient presented to our Emergency Department with acute neurological symptoms, which were found to be related to his malfunctioning Deep Brain Stimulator (DBS). As doctors, this was our first encounter with such a case and it posed difficult medical and technological challenges. A number of similar cases, in which patients with malfunctioning DBS devices have presented with abnormal medical symptoms, have been reported in the wider literature. Increasingly, these devices are being monitored remotely by specialists centers and the telemetric nature of these devices leaves them open to malicious hacks. 

More than 100,000 patients worldwide have received Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for neurological conditions. The adoption of ‘neurotechnology’ or ‘brain-computer interfaces’ has increased across the medical domain for neurological conditions (e.g. Parkinsons), but also for ‘emerging indications’ including OCD, Depression and Bipolar disorder. Additionally, beyond the healthcare space, ‘brain chips’ are receiving increasing attention for their promise to enhance cognition, augment reality and manage emotions.

Hacking brain stimulators (‘brain jacking’) has so far only been reported in theory [1-3]. Targeted attacks of telemetric DBS devices to affect voltage/current and frequency settings could induce impairment of motor function, alteration of impulse control, induction of pain and manipulation of emotions [1-3]. The ability of hackers to exert malicious control over brain implants has dangerous and potentially life threatening consequences. For our patients and the wider community, we want to understand these threats and develop protective measures to secure the neuro-integrity of our patients.

Recognising and responding to hacks of deep brain devices requires an interdisciplinary response. We need data scientists and hackers who understand the vulnerabilities of telemetric systems and potential routes of tech-induced harm. We need medical physicians and neuroanatomists to understand the clinical syndromes that may arise from the intersection of human physiology and digital manipulation. The workshop will start with a presentation describing the medical case of DBS failure. Following this, we invite participants to brainstorm ideas for how a DBS system could be hacked and to consider the ethical issues of this research. We will divide the audience into small groups and ask them to consider the following questions:

Questions for workshop participants would include
(i) Vulnerabilities: How would you hack a telemetric DBS device? What attacks is it likely to encounter? What are its vulnerabilities?
(ii) Defense: What options could improve the security of these devices? 
(iii) Ethics: What are the arguments for and against these devices being used in healthcare? 

Following group discussions we will reconvene and share our thoughts and recommendations. We invite people from all disciplinary backgrounds to attend and share their thoughts on potential vulnerabilities and solutions for these systems.

                <language>en</language>
                <abstract>In this workshop, we will learn how to assemble tiny parts on circuit boards by building an electronic touch-activated purring kitten. Anyone can do it. Yes, even you who never touched anything electronic before. Takes 120mins, 20€/kit, avoid caffeine immediately before. Max 10 participants per session, sign up on PAPER at the Hardware Hacking Area.</abstract>
                <description>Takes about two hours. Basic workshop. No prior knowledge needed. Materials cost 20€ per kit.

We are going to build an electronic kitten using tiny tiny SMD parts. It will purr when you touch it right and hiss when you touch it wrong. It's going to work. You will learn how to make your hands not shake at all ever. You will learn how to activate your builtin precision positioning superpowers.

For people afraid of surface mount assembly/rework. You know those tiny little components in modern electronic devices? It's both possible and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you how!

Think you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s? Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is minimal and you probably already have it. We'll learn the answer to THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no longer need to be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before the workshop, because shaky hands are a disadvantage.

The workshop kit costs 20€. Please SIGN UP ON THE PAPER LIST at the Hardware Hacking Area. PLEASE BE ON TIME!</description>

                <abstract>People have been modeling different parts of Earth's systems for decades, on different scales and with different goals from short term weather forecasting through actuarial risk prediction to long term climate models. In this talk I'll explore some of the typical models, methods, data formats, infrastructure layouts and design assumptions that go into such models, and discuss some low hanging fruit available to improve them.</abstract>
                <description>Earth is a pretty complicated system, consisting of numerous sub-systems operating at different time and energy scales. All the systems are strongly coupled. These include the atmosphere, oceans, freshwater, cryosphere and biosphere, all of which can be further subdivided by various schemes. 

The problems facing people trying to model these systems are numerous: there's a lot of data, all of it is bad, most of the code is written in Fortran, and all of it is horribly slow.

To make matters worse, modeling Earth is computationally intractable without some simplifying assumptions. For instance, if your global grid for weather prediction has "pixels" that represent more than 16km², the physical parameterization can't "see" convection, so you miss most storms. And yet somehow people manage.

In this talk, we'll start with a brief introduction to how some Earth systems work, describe some parameterizations, and then look at different free software/open source models operating under different domains, assumptions, and scales. Finally, we'll do a quick review of some of the many places where there is room for improvement.</description>

                <abstract>Based on participant observation and user studies, this short talk shares insights about surveilllance self-defense and communication tactics of anti-war activists in Russia. It explores current surveillance techniques used by Russian government to identify and persecute anti-war protesters and analyses digital migration patterns of Russian activists towards alternative communication tools.</abstract>
                <description>Since the beginning of Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian society was quickly polarized. The government started to control the discours about war and silence all kinds of alternative narratives and opposition voices. The anti-war movement quickly found itself in deep underground and in high-risk, with more than 10 000 arrests during rallies against the war and hundreds new criminal cases against those who dare to speak out the truth about Russian army atrocities committed in Ukraine.

This talk is based on my own experience as a member of anti-war resistance, and as a Russian girl married to a Ukrainian guy. We have just escaped from Russia to western Europe. 

Apart from being an activist, I am involved in the scene of digital security and secure messaging since 2016, working with the team of Delta Chat messenger as a UX-researcher, and studying usage of secure messaging apps in high-risk areas such as Ukraine, Belarus, Syria, Iran and so on. I have recently published a book based on 4 years of fieldwork entitled "Concealing for Freedom. The making of encryption and online civil liberties" that traces recent history of most famous end-to-end encrypted messaging apps and their usages in at-risk areas.

In this talk I would like to describe the current state of Russian surveillance technologies and practices used to prosecute and identify anti-war activists. I will also describe how the war affected Internet governance and Internet censorship in Russia and what are the consequences for the opposition, media and civil society. I will share my analysis of user patterns in terms of digital self defense, namely, growing interest in decentralized, p2p or federated messaging alternatives as opposed to centralized ones. 

My talk will be structured not so much as an academic presentation but rather as a set of stories from the field. And I would like to use half of the time for an active discussion with the audience about how to help those who stayed inside Russia and try to oppose the war. What tools and what tactics could we recommend them?</description>

                <abstract>The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure scans the internet for vulnerabilities and reports these to the people who can fix them. Our researchers will go into some of our recent cases, our board members will describe how we professionalise vulnerability disclosure and why we are allowed to somewhat break laws on computer crime and privacy.</abstract>
                <description>The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure scans the internet from our own AS (50.559) for vulnerabilities and reports these to the people who can fix them. In this session our board members will describe how we professionalise vulnerability disclosure with an independent foundation, a Code of Conduct, a common identity, a collaboration platform for independent researchers and a CSIRT to report vulnerabilities to owners of vulnerable systems. 
Our researchers will go into some of our more known cases, ranging from Citrix 2020, to KaseyaVSA and Log4j in 2021 and others which commenced between filing this proposal and the conference. They will demonstrate how to scan, validate data, report to users and how they responded. 
By doing this, we kind of break several laws on computer crime and privacy protection. Still, we are allowed to as we serve to make the internet more secure. Moreover, we also guide young security researchers to the responsible path of vulnerability disclosure. And we do it Dutch style: open, direct and for free.
Chris and Astrid will go into the way we work, Frank and Lennaert will do the cases.</description>

                <abstract>Many 5G networks are built in fundamentally new ways, opening new hacking avenues.
Mobile networks have so far been monolithic systems from big vendors. Networks are rapidly changing to an "open" model that mixes software from specialized vendors, hosted in cloud environments.

The talk dives into the hacking potential of the technologies and new interfaces needed for these open networks. We illustrate the security challenges with vulnerabilities we found in real-world networks.</abstract>
                <description># Background #

Mobile networks are undergoing a paradigm shift from single-vendor monoliths to open cloud environments. Telco software now comes from different vendors and is installed on commodity hardware.

OpenRAN is introduced in many (not all) 5G network globally. Operators hope that OpenRAN will be more flexible and cheaper. But what about security?

To make building blocks interoperable, OpenRAN comes with new interfaces, with often unclear security properties. OpenRAN also adds complex IT technologies, which come with their own hacking issues. Many components are run on Linux in Docker containers on top of Kubernetes, adding multiple layers of possible hacking interference.

Mobile networks also become easier to test, including for pentesters with experience in web apps and cloud environments. This talk explores how we can best use this new accessibility.

# What we discuss #

*1. Technology overview.* Which technologies and interfaces are used in OpenRAN

*2. Baseline security.* Which security measures are part of OpenRAN, and which gaps are left open

*3. Pentest/hacking advice.* How do you test whether a network uses necessary security measures

*4. Tales of caution.* Vulnerabilities we found in real-world networks</description>

                <abstract>From complaining out loud about a televised government app-a-thon to being hired by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport as lead developer RoHS running a team of devs to work on all the covid backend infrastructure exception routes and making sure no person is left in digital limbo in just under an hour.</abstract>
                <description>When late 2019 the first signs from China of the novel Corona virus came I was intrigued,
During the first "lock down" in the Netherlands our Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport created an app-a-thon . . and much hilarity ensued. 

As all geeks had seen . . nice ideas people . . but Apple and Google already have a standard agreed.
And a lot of us "Dutch Hackers" where pretty vocal about it as usual.

Meanwhile at "the ministry" a civil servant started hiring people from the Dutch hacker scene.

Late December 2020 it came to their attention that there was some missing or ancient infrastructure in place for vaccine registration, not at all ready for the then upcoming vaccination landrush.

14th of December I get a call . . can you clean your calendar for the year?

Sure . . just over two weeks, one of them I had planned as holiday anyway to watch CCCongres talks. . 

Little did I know they meant clear agenda for 2021 .. and 2022 . . not 2020.

This story takes you from getting very privacy and security aware infrastructure for registering the first ever Covid vaccination in the Netherlands built and tested in 3 weeks to the current state of the DCC infra up close and personal.</description>

                <abstract>SLAPP suits (strategic lawsuits against public participation) are nuisance lawsuits designed to get journalists, activists, historians, whistleblowers and others to keep quiet. This kind of lawfare isn't new, but there is an increasing focus on the issue in Europe, with new legislation coming. Here's where you find out more.</abstract>
                <description>You receive a threatening letter from a major law firm, probably based in London, trying to stop your reporting, or your activism, threatening you as an individual as well as the organisation you are affiliated with - congratulations, you've just been SLAPPed.

Strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) are on the increase worldwide, and Europe is beginning to take notice. Lawyers' associations in Italy and Croatia report hundreds of nuisance suits being laid against journalists. In Hungary, Poland and Slovenia, the state and its allies are SLAPPing opponents - journalists, anticorruption activists, LGBTI+ rights advocates - with impunity.

Litigation has been turned against the activist community, oligarchs try to silence debate and  Eastern Europe has become the new home of SLAPP-based oppression, as politics slide into autocracy and leaders stamp down on dissent.

Blueprint is part of an 11-country coalition working on the ground to train lawyers to help the victims of SLAPPs strike back. We're currently developing a curriculum from scratch, drawing on European human rights principles and local knowledge.

If you want to understand the European situation better, or if you have experience of SLAPPS and can help us understand what kinds of legal training and other defences are useful to civil society, we'd love for you to join this conversation.</description>

                <description>The Albert Heijn, everyone (in the Netherlands at least) knows it. It's one of the largest supermarket chains with a very extensive API. This API is not public unfortunately, but in this talk I will show you how you can reverse engineer the app to figure out how the API works and how we can use it to our advantage.

AirMiles, tracking stamps for the current saving program, receipts, personal discounts. All these can be viewed or tracked within the Albert Heijn app. But, what if you want to track your savings over time? I want my pretty Grafana dashboard gosh darn it! 

This talk will go into the story behind randombonuskaart.nl (a website for a 'random' bonuskaart right when you need it), talk about how your private API is not really private and how we can use the Albert Heijn API to track various data and do tedious actions for us.

The knowledge gained from this talk can also be used with other apps, but the Albert Heijn app proves for a very good example.</description>

                <abstract>This session will go over my journey to hack the Quincy drawing robot. This is a cheap 3-axis drawing robot, that uses a proprietary "closed" system. I wanted to hack this robot to draw Pokémon's for my son. I will explain how I deciphered the file formats, figured out how the robot could be controlled (which needed some very very difficult math!) and the software I made to create your own drawings.

BONUS: At the end of the session you can WIN one of these Quincy Robots!!!</abstract>
                <description>This session will explain step by step the process I took to decode the proprietary file formats, using some simple python coding. This will give you an insight in general how you can try to decode file formats that are not documented. 

Besides understanding the files, the math behind controlling this robot turned out to be very complicated. I will explain the difficulty and if you are a Math Nerd you can see if you could solve this difficult challenge.  

Finally I will show the software I made to create your own drawing files.</description>

                <abstract>Last April we won Pwn2Own Miami by demonstrating five zero-day attacks against software that is commonly used in the ICS world. ICS, or Industrial Control Systems, are systems that are involved with running an industrial process, for example in a factory or power plant. Our targets range from SCADA to HMI systems. During this talk we would like to share details about the competition and the vulnerabilities we found.</abstract>
                <description>ICS is an interesting field for security research. As a successful attack could have devastating results. Luckily the number of successful attacks that truly targeted ICS environments are scarce. At the same time this industry faces some difficult challenges, such as high availability requirements, old technology and a low security maturity.

Pwn2Own Miami is an annual edition of the Pwn2Own competition, that focuses solely on ICS applications. Targets range from OPC UA implementations (on of the main communication protocol in ICS), to data gateways and SCADA systems. They challenge competitors to find zero-days attacks against any of the targets. Participants need to demonstrate their zero-days by compromising a target machine running the latest version of the application.

Last year we participated in the Pwn2Own Austin edition, which focused on Enterprise applications, with a zero-day chain against the Zoom client. This year we decided to participate in the ICS edition. It was a close race, but ultimately we beat the competing teams and won this year's edition. We demonstrated 3 RCE's, one DoS and an interesting certificate verification bypass, which in total was good for 90 points and $90,000.</description>

This talk discusses how the lock works in a master keyed system and how it can possibly be defeated. It will cover decoding, picking and key duplication.</abstract>
                <description>The Anker 3800 is a mechanical lock that has both traditional pins as well as magnetic sliders. It was designed by Japanese company MIWA and is sold in the Netherlands under the Anker brand. It is a high security lock that is often used in large master keyed systems.

I wondered: can it be opened without the key? I will present my adventures with the lock, having opened it up to see how it works, and several things I have tried to copy the key, pick the lock, decode the lock and find out what the master key looks like. The talk will include successes and failures and I will discuss designing 3D models, C&amp;C work, electronics, Arduino programming, PCB design, and more.

The talk is aimed at people with an interest in lockpicking. No prior knowledge is necessary.</description>

                <abstract>We will give you a short overview over the current electric vehicle charging technology and why it sucks. Let's try to fix it with the open source software stack EVerest! We will explain the technology and architecture behind it and will invite you to join our efforts forward to a green sustainable transportation infrastructure.</abstract>
                <description>Building a standard for EV charging infrastructure failed so far for multiple reasons: "Innovations" are implemented on a timescale of years to decades, and the standard is typically “designed by committee”. Every new player in the game has to reimplement the standard and it's done typically “very lean”, which is furthermore delaying and bugging the situation.
Our solution is to establish a open-source based SW stack for charging systems, which all companies, manufacturers and private persons can use and make it the common de-facto standard. By opening the software for all, anyone can help improve it. 
We have already made some progress on our SW stack called EVerest and we would like to welcome you all in helping to transform the EV charging world. EVerest is part of the Linux Foundation Energy, a community lead by the green energy transition.</description>

                <abstract>This is a rant about how moving ecosystems are not a good reason for centralizing a crucial service, how stickers are no substitute for a desktop client that does not crash, and how effectively shutting out less popular OS platforms is just not cool.</abstract>
                <description>In his seminal work ["The ecosystem is moving"](https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/), Moxie Marlinspike laid out clearly the reasons why it's impossible to do what [Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)), or [the Fediverse](https://fediverse.party/), or for that matter the Web, have done: create a dynamic, quickly-evolving ecosystem without centralizing it.

For years, as a person responsible for information security of at-risk reporters and their sources, I have been advocating Signal as a secure Internet messaging service. And with good reasons.

Criticizing a security-sensitive tool like Signal is tricky, as it might be misconstrued as a call to abandon it, and move to alternatives that might be in fact worse. But here, at a hacker conference and with little risk of causing confusion and diverting users towards less secure platforms, can we please have an honest conversation about Signal's problems? And how 5 years after that blogpost, moxie's centralization has not solved them?..

There are good reasons to exert a level of control over what connects to a communication network. But effectively shutting out a community of developers that would love to implement Signal clients [for](https://gitlab.com/rubdos/whisperfish) [less](https://open-store.io/app/textsecure.nanuc) [popular](https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=8505) [OSes](https://forums.puri.sm/t/how-can-you-install-signal-on-the-librem-5/10244) (many of which happen to attract the kind of infosec-aware crowd that used to be the core pushers of Signal) is not a good outcome.

Opening up more on the client side and providing some form of independent client development program (starting with a stable API) would already help a ton. Even if it's just the desktop client that gets re-written in something that is not in essence a packaged browser [trailing it's upstream on security patches](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22239791).

Finally, we need to talk federation. Does it make moving fast and breaking things more difficult? Yes, yes it does, and that can be a good thing. It also makes the resulting federated service more resilient (one [service provider experiencing issues](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/signal-users-globally-experiencing-issues-company-working-on-a-fix-1759524-2021-01-15) does not bring the whole network down). And, it lets others innovate without being locked out.</description>

                <abstract>E-signatures in your country are insecure.
They have been hacked 10 years ago.
Everyone knew that but no one wanted to talk about it since there is no easy fix.

We decided to create a PoC and poke the government with it.

This is a story on what happened.

⭐ PoCs included ⭐</abstract>
                <description>Electronically signed documents were a great relief to organizing our daily life during the pandemic. They have actually been helping us for many years (depending on the country).

It's been known for some time that **dynamic content + e-signatures = trouble**, but we were surprised that no one has really done anything about it.
In 2021 we got tired of explaining the vulnerability each partner that sends in a vulnerable asice for signing, so we created multiple practical PoC that allow you to modify content of e-signed documents post-signing.

Some of these PoC work against many countries. And there is PoC for every single country.

- What is the actual impact?
- Why is no-one fixing this?
- Can we even fix it?
- What are we gonna do about it then?</description>

                <abstract>Medical devices come in all shapes and sizes, and a great deal of them contain – or consist of – software. If they are faulty, they can kill.  We’ll talk about different types and classes of medical devices, the regulations that try to ensure their safety and what all of this means for medical software projects.</abstract>
                <description>So you have a great idea for a medical product with software that will make the world a better place? It helps people to regain or improve their health, cope with a permanent condition or analyze their vital stats? That’s fantastic! What could possibly go wrong?

History has shown that faults in medical devices can have disastrous consequences. Those products may cause severe injury, permanent damage, even death. In order to make sure that your product does not harm its users there is a bunch of regulations that you have to comply with. How does this affect your work? 

First we’ll take a look at where to find software in or around medical devices from embedded code to stand-alone sofware with AI. Then I’ll provide a few infamous examples of what went wrong (including a great talk about faulty software in pacemakers from CCC Camp 2019 – you know, that last great event before THE VIRUS).

Then we’ll talk about the regulatory part, especially at the EU Medical Device Regulation and what it means for planning, implementing and maintaining software for medical products (my favourite topic: traceability. ;-) ). It’s also of interest for non-EU participants because many of the regulations are ISO-harmonized.</description>

                <description>If we consider technology sufficiently advanced indistinguishable from magic, then the closest we get to ancient magical glyphs are barcodes. In this talk, we will show how barcodes are not just simple numbers, but can be used to control the machines.

In this talk we do a brief introduction into barcodes, the way they are built, their uses and their misuses. This will be illustrated with a couple of examples of misuses in the real world.

After this, we will demonstrate how a common implementation of (barcode)-scanning is vulnerable to a deceptively simple attack, which can lead to some interesting results.</description>

                <abstract>Attacks on cyber physical systems are perceived as necessarily complex and requiring significant time and resources. However, in the last couple years we have also observed the inverse: simple attacks where actors with varying levels of skill and few resources gain access to software and interfaces that control physical processes. These compromises appear to be driven by ideological, egotistical, or financial objectives, taking advantage of an ample supply of internet-connected cyber physical systems. This is sometimes concerning, for example when it is affects panels for controlling processes in a water facilities or manufacturing processes. Sometimes, though, it is absurd, such as when the critical systems actors claim to compromise are in fact toys or domestic appliances. In this talk, we will share a series of stories of success and failure involving low sophistication compromises on cyber physical systems. We will describe the different types of cases we have observed, what the actors did, and how you can reproduce them for good. At last, we will discuss to what extent these crimes of opportunity represent a risk to cyber physical systems and what we can do about it.</abstract>
                <description>In november 2021, I presented a version of this talk at a local non-profit event in Bergamo, Italy. For this event - NoHat - I focused on sharing the stories of low sophistication compromises we observed involving software used to control physical processes. However, for MCH I did some modifications in the title and the presentation itself to share not only the cases, but also how to reproduce them for good.

The purpose of this talk is to share with the audience how actors without necessarily a lot of skills or resources are using very simple tools to hack cyber physical systems. I will do some experiments to show very quick results the audience can get reproducing these techniques so that they learn how to find these internet-connected cyber physical assets and notify the owners.

The outline of the initial presentation was:

•	Introduction
o	Story: Hacked kitchen was supposed to be a gas system
•	Define low sophistication cyber physical compromises
•	(De)evolution of cyber physical threats
o	From state-sponsored to financial, and now opportunistic
•	Describe low sophistication compromises of cyber physical systems
o	Distribution and claims of exposed systems
o	Seeming actor motivations
o	Common actor techniques
o	Types of evidence (or lack of)
•	Low Sophistication Threat Actors Access HMIs and Manipulate Control Processes
o	Oldsmar, Florida modified HMI on water facility
o	Israel’s advisory on compromises to water facility systems
o	Solar energy and dam surveillance system
o	Hotel BAS
•	Amateur Actors Show Limited OT Expertise
o	“Train control system” was in fact a human resources tool
o	Second “train control system” controls toy trains
o	Website leaks claiming access to SCADA systems
•	Hacktivist and Researcher Tutorials
o	Two hacktivist groups share tutorials for finding and compromising cyber physical systems
o	Researchers have done too – including a couple examples, such as a recent script to identify tank gauges
•	Does this activity pose an actual risk to cyber physical systems?
o	Each incident provides threat actors with opportunities to learn more about OT, such as the underlying technology, physical processes, and operations.
o	Even low-sophistication intrusions into OT environments carry the risk of disruption to physical processes, mainly in the case of industries or organizations with less mature security practices.
o	The publicity of these incidents normalizes cyber operations against OT and may encourage other threat actors to increasingly target or impact these systems.
•	On the bright side…
o	There are safety methods in place that stop immediate computer instructions from modifying actual physical processes
	Engineering and human processes
	Missing security on the software side

                <abstract>What are the risks and problems of face search engines like Clearview AI and PimEyes? Since institutional protection against these systems is failing us, how can we protect ourselves against this? Three people involved in the fight against biometric mass surveillance share their experiences and reflections. Come to this talk to exchange experiences, learn what tools there are for your protection, how to use them and how you can help stop the creep of mass surveillance technologies.</abstract>
                <description>Face search engines like [Clearview AI](https://reclaimyourface.eu/how-to-reclaim-your-face-from-clearview-ai/) and [Pimeyes](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/04/tech/pimeyes-facial-recognition/index.html) have all our faces and process our biometric data. They didn't ask us if we like their *service* and if they may use our data. Users of these search engines can now identify us anytime, anywhere.

Since biometric data enjoy special protection under GDPR, we filed complaints in multiple European states. We report how data protection authorities did nothing for a long time and tell of the first successes. However, it became clear that GDPR does not protect against biometric surveillance.

That's why we have joined forces to form the **[Reclaim Your Face](https://reclaimyourface.eu/)** campaign. Together, we call on the European Commission to strictly regulate the use of biometric technilogies in order to avoid undue interference with fundamental rights. In particular, we ask the Commission to prohibit, in law and in practice, indiscriminate or arbitrarily-targeted uses of biometrics which can lead to unlawful mass surveillance.

The two face search engines are not the only examples of everyday biometric surveillance. However, it is difficult to track where else we are being monitored: There is a lack of transparency and oversight. Public authorities and private companies rarely report on their own what they have been up to. We share how we've used FOIA requests, among other things, to create a little more publicity.</description>

                <abstract>Stalking is unwanted and/or repeated surveillance by an individual or group toward another person. But what is the impact of tech companies making it easier to do this with the development of technology? In the news, we hear about the increase in stalkerware found on devices or scary government spyware. But it’s not just that, there are so many more common tools used by stalkers.</abstract>
                <description>From September 2020 to May 2021, the number of devices infected with stalkerware increased by 63 percent, according to a study by Norton Labs. But stalkerware is not what I encounter most when I get contacted by stalking victims. Almost anyone can become a victim of stalking; stalkers do not just target celebrities. Sometimes they are ex-partners known to the victim, other times they may be a casual acquaintance, or just a simple stranger. With stalkerware, the actor needs access to the device or needs to persuade the victim to install something. In cases where the stalker is a (ex-)partner, that might be doable. But in other cases, it is easier to gain access to the accounts of the victim, gather information about the victim from social media, or use tracking devices (looking at you Apple and Tile) to follow the victim. Tech companies develop new apps and gadgets seemingly without thinking about other ways these can be used. And they end up making it easier to stalk someone. But what can we do about this problem? Should we lower efforts hunting stalkerware and help victims gather evidence? Or can we do something else.</description>

                <abstract>When gathering data for public services becomes privacy infringement and what you as a citizen can do about it. Or:  How I made the municipality pay a 600.000 euro fine for invading your privacy. 

In September 2017 The Municipality of Enschede started tracking visitor movements in the city center 24/7 by registering their mobile phones WIFI MAC addresses. Is this an infringement on our privacy, even when the underlying identities remain concealed?</abstract>
                <description>In September 2017 The Municipality of Enschede started tracking visitor movements in the city center 24/7 by registering their mobile phones WIFI MAC addresses. Is this an infringement on our privacy, even when the underlying identities remain concealed? Yes it is, claimed speaker and privacy activist Dave Borghuis. After a 4 year process the dutch DPA agreed and Enschede was charge a massive fine for its infringement. Now, can we learn from this case? Where does or should our privacy start? And what can we, as citizens, do to protect our freedom to move about in privacy?

There’s a lot to learn from every ransomware attack. By demounting every bit of the attack and looking at every stage there’s much to gain for setting up proper detection and other defence techniques</abstract>
                <description>Remember those times when a popup appeared on your screen with the message to immediately transfer an amount of bitcoins to retrieve your files? Ransomware is still a serious threat to a lot of people and organisations and nowadays using more and more advanced techniques to target you and steal your data. This talk will tell us what Ransomware actually is, who’s writing the code and making money out of it, it shows us a bit of the Ransomware history and what types were out there, to better understand what we’re dealing with. And explain all of the ransomware attack stages and what you can do in terms of detection and defence inside your security operations.</description>

                <abstract>Modern electronic locks are often optimized for cost, not security. Or their manufacturers don’t do security research. Or they ignore it. 
For whatever reason, many current electronic lock systems are susceptible to surprisingly simple attacks. We’ll look at some of them, and at the underlying basics, so that you can do your own research.</abstract>
                <description>In this talk, we look at a number of modern electronic locks and their security flaws. Surprisingly many current systems are susceptible to very simple attacks, like the equivalent of using bump keys. Of course, there are electronic and/or SW-based attacks, too.
We’ll look at some of them, and at the underlying basics, so that you can do your own research. 
Some of the problems have been fixed by manufacturers, but typically only for future production runs, so you will get some practical advice on how to test your own hardware for these critical flaws.</description>

                <abstract>Tired of clothing stores not having your size, or that you're stuck in between sizes? So was Joost de Cock, he didn't - and doesn't - like how clothing stores base their clothing sizes on an imaginary average person; every person has a different body. That got him to found FreeSewing: the open-source platform that translates custom measurements into well-fitting sewing patterns with code.

The platform is working towards becoming the Wikipedia of sewing patterns, with new patterns being released every few months, plus a bunch of guides on how to sew. The platform also provides guides for designers and developers, to transform patterns into code. 

This system based on code allows not only for custom measurements, but also for tweaking the pattern (e.g. longer sleeves, or a crop top) and recycling parts of one pattern into another - whereas a traditional sewing pattern is based on the measurements of a perfect mannequin, which is then graded up and down for different body types, which is known to have many downsides.

This talk will not be held by founder Joost de Cock himself, but by an enthusiastic contributor. He will gladly go more in depth on how the code works, common pitfalls, the motivation behind it and how it helps against the rise of fast fashion - maybe encouraging some to pick up sewing themselves?</abstract>
                <description>A platform that can make tailored sewing patterns, it sounds great - but how does it work exactly? 

It definitely is an upgrade from traditional sewing patterns. Making sewing patterns may sound easy: they are pieces of fabric, shaped in a specific way and sewn in a specific way. For example, a t-shirt pattern will have these parts: a front, a back and sleeves. But to figure out the right shape, the average pattern designer will make their design based on the shape of their perfect mannequin, and they grade it up and down for different body types. Adapting the pattern for a different shape can be a tedious task. That's where FreeSewing comes into play: sewing patterns aren't based on the measurements of one fit model, but they're parameters; they vary based on what the user puts into the system.

And the platform doesn't just provide sewing patterns; it also has a lot of guides available, for general sewing, specific sewing patterns and even on how to code a pattern into the system. This makes it not just a platform for sewists, but also for designers and developers.

So, enough about how cool I think it is, what exactly do I mean with "sewing patterns based on code"? FreeSewing is written in JavaScript and the technique is quite similar to how you would draw a traditional pattern: a bunch of lines for the right measurements, but now a system is drawing those lines for you. A line needs a beginning point and an end point, usually also points that determine the curve; the 'coordinates' of these points are based on the measurements.

The sewing patterns aren't just based on custom measurements, but you can also tweak them however you'd like (and within what's possible), e.g. wanting longer sleeves, or a crop top. Another advantage of having code as a base is that you can 'recycle' pattern parts from one sewing pattern into another.

Not just the sewing patterns are easily accessible online, but also the software needed to create the code: the core library and patterns are available both for NodeJS and the browser. The code and markdown content is hosted by [Github](https://github.com/freesewing/). 

I'm happy that this project wasn't created by a capitalist overlord, but by someone who wanted to change the world for the better. Now there are a lot of sewing patterns available for all types of bodies and I hope it will encourage more people to start sewing their own clothes. Sewing is difficult to learn, not to mention coding, but it's so worth it. Luckily FreeSewing has a vibrant community where there's always someone ready to help with problems. My goal is to share this enthusiasm with others and maybe encourage some to pick up sewing or help out with coding.</description>

                <abstract>A tale of sketchy^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hawesome online shopping, grimy scrap bins, and crazy DIY projects: 
The adventures of a few friends who set up an electron-microscopy lab (and much more!) without breaking the bank. For all audiences: whether you just want to see some cool micrographs, hear a story of hacker adventure, or, want to set up your own SEM - this should be a good time.</abstract>
                <description>This talk will have several parts:

First we will tell you a story of a hobby that started with modifying an old classroom microscope for 
semiconductor imaging and has led to owning one, possibly two scanning electron microscopes (SEMs).  You will see how 2020's logistics drama, COVID, language barriers, etc resulted turned the "simple" task of buying an electron microscope into a roller coaster of an adventure.

Part two will look at the things we learned and what *you* should look out for if you want to get your own SEM: Things that will break, physics to watch out for, requirements for running it, and understanding the things that set different SEMs apart.

Finally, we want to look at the future: Can we get a community of hackers building their own chips or replicating material science papers similar to the one we see abroad? Their achievements have been non-trivial to translate to European reality, but not impossible to. We hope to spur this on.</description>

                <abstract>We all know that the value of pi is a constant with a particular immutable value. Anyone who has done any graphical programming also knows that visual rendering relies not just on pi but trigonometry more broadly as well as other mathematical techniques. If we look into the source code of the first person shooter Doom we find that the value of pi used in the game is wrong. In this talk I will explore what happens when we subtly and not so subtly break math in the source.</abstract>
                <description>Doom is a well known classic first person shooter game with source code released under the GPL in 1999. In this talk I will begin by exploring what happens to the game when we make the value of pi even more wrong. What about when we change other trigonometric functions and constants to incorrect values? How will our familiar understanding and ability to traverse this virtual world change when we do this. Are there any interesting gaming possibilities with non-Euclidean geometries? A brief segway will cover some optimization tricks made to enable the game to run well on hardware available at the time. At the end I will provide a link to other games and public source code repositories that also use an incorrect value of pi. Pointers will also be provided to allow the audience to compile their own incorrect math version of the game.</description>

                <abstract>What happens when your home is “smart” before you even move in? More and more buildings are pre-installing smart devices that tenants didn’t ask for and may not want. These devices focus on comfort and convenience, an excellent focus as long as security is also considered. Given the deep integration these devices have, a vulnerable system could lead to devastating consequences like the loss of privacy and even unauthorized access. As a security researcher, these were my thoughts when I saw the tablet mounted on the wall of my new apartment.

In a short period, I discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the system. A concern for sure, considering the system allows for remote access and has integration with services in my apartment and the building. This talk will cover my path, my process, and coverage of the vulnerabilities I discovered.</abstract>
                <description>The smart home system is based on a wall-mounted Android tablet, and is installed in thousands of properties throughout Europe. It allows for controlling lights, heating, motorized blinds, opening a building's main entrance door among other things.

The talk will contain the following contents:

* Introduction
* Presentation of the smart home system
* Methodology
  * How did I evaluate its security
* Findings
  * Description of vulnerabilities found
  * Impacts and countermeasures
* Disclosure timeline
* Interactions with vendor
* Raise awareness
* Conclusion</description>

                <abstract>Ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you click buy on that domain for a new side project that'll definitely happen (you will get to it eventually, right)? Well this is the talk for you! We'll cover all the extremely cursed details of how exactly one sells and manages a domain, the standards for this (or lack thereof), and some pointers for how you could get started managing your own domains directly, if you're not completely put off by this talk's contents.</abstract>
                <description>Back at the start of lockdown in 2020 I think we where all a bit bored at home with not much to do; well, me and a friend decided it would be a good idea to start a domain registrar (big mistake, big, huge). This is the tale of how that went, what we learn, and why you might not want to do it yourself. 

We'll cover the technical aspects of how a domain is actually managed by your registrar, touch on the absolutely crazy business structures of the domain world with the likes of ICANN and friends, and how we ended up in this situation. Some of the standards are extremely cursed, some are extremely old, most are both. We'll also cover more recent developments in the domain space, such as the move from WHOIS to RDAP, and improvements in DNSSEC deployment.

And finally after all that if you decide that somehow this is something you want more of in your life we'll give some pointers for how one might setup their own registrar, especially if they want to take greater control of their own domains, or just have some fun.</description>

                <abstract>This presentation will includes insights in starting your own online pirate radiostation, the mathematics of bingo cards, keeping participants data up to GDPR standards, Fitbit-statistics, and the optimization of bingo winner-calculations. This presentation will also at one point include a guy in an ice cream cone costume with an offensive name, as well as an optional disco bingo party with songs supplied by visitors to the conference.</abstract>
                <description>As the first Covid lockdown made it impossible to continue hosting live events in pubs, many presenters and questioneers quickly adapted to hosting online quizzes. Slightly depressed by the notion that online quizzes would involve a great amount of cheating and the thought that participants would see it as an “okay substitute for the offline version”, I choose to develop an online event that would be impossible to cheat and would give people a unique experience, whilst still being a game that can also be played in pubs.

When this presentation is held, there will have been at least 200 installments of DJ Cone Yo’s online Discobingo, with over 5.000 participants on all 6 continents, all from a laptop on a nightstand next to my bed. It proved to be an event accessible to both Children as well as high-level employees of companies such as Deloitte, PWC, Gemeente Amsterdam, and then some.

Please note that this will not be a presentation on any personal accomplishment with this event. Because let’s be honest: it’s a guy doing digital conga shuffles in front of the webcam. However, during the development of this activity I learned how to build up an https online radio server with Icecast2, created calculation models in excel to manufacture unique cards, optimized this data to supply me predictive data to rapidly check results, and created a way to supply participants with all information, including unique cards, whilst living up to GDPR-standards. With this presentation I’d like to provide some inspiration regarding how to develop each of these things without any knowledge of programming and using some of the most basic pieces of software. Also: share the joy of bingo math.

There is an option to also do a shared evening activity. People can supply songs for an evening discobingo which can be played in multiple locations at the same time. So if there are any restrictions still set, the radio stream can be played in tents or in smaller groups, and everyone that wishes to join can receive a unique card and play along. In the spirit of the event, people can even submit their own prizes to the bingo as to share them with others at the festival.

And on a personal note:
After visiting SHA2017 back when I was working as a campaign strategist for Bits of Freedom (where I got to design campaigns such as the Rijksveiligheidsdienst) I have thought about how amazing it would be to do a presentation at one of these events. Back then, me and a few colleagues specifically enjoyed a presentation on “how to start an escape room”. Doing something along these lines and sharing insights gained from developing entertainment is something I am good at.</description>

                <abstract>A series of isolated problems encountered when attempting to fuzz software, in this case Adobe Reader (DC), and hackish solutions to said problems. Constructing a fuzzing pipeline capable of finding real bugs by stringing together freely available tools creating the bare minimum of glue.</abstract>
                <description>Starting from target selection, moving over requirements for a given fuzzing campaign to smart input generation, briefly touching on scaling challenges and performance issues. This presentation describes a practical approach to creating a fuzzing pipeline with the purpose of finding real world bugs in closed source software, in this case Adobe Reader (dc). The approach taken is suitable for anyone with basic scripting capabilities, is easy to replicate, and leads to bug hunting capabilities without a doctoral degree or years of experience in vulnerability discovery.</description>

                <abstract>Greenpeace is a direct action organisation. We have been doing physical direct civil disobedience actions for 50 years now. Civil disobedience has always played an important part in evolving democratic society if you look for instance at womens’ voting rights, the civil rights movement in the US and de ‘klimaatspijbelaars’. The digital realm is becoming more and more important in all of our lives. That is why we are working on a research project on what digital civil disobedience can look like. This is something else than mere ‘clicktivism’. What are the differences and similarities of online and offline civil disobedience? How do you 'drop' a digital banner or how do we digitally 'occupy' a building or mine? During this talk we want to tell about this project and give you an insight look on how we prepare disobedient actions at Greenpeace.</abstract>
                <description>Greenpeace is a direct action organisation. We have been doing direct civil disobedient actions for over 40 years now. At Greenpeace we know our strength and our weaknesses when doing actions in physical spaces. We scale buildings and hang banners, we have blocked the petrol harbour in Rotterdam (multiple times) and we stop oil/gas rigs from operating. All these kinds of actions are part of a struggle for a healthy climate and safe planet to live on and so ideologically motivated. 

The right to protest is a fundamental European right, a right that is very dear to us and important when chased by the law. At Greenpeace we always look at new ways to do disobedient actions. This is why we started a research on how online actions can contribute to campaigns. The last few months we have been looking into the possibilities of digital civil disobedience actions. We looked at the risks, the actions and the possibilities it will bring. One thing we learned is that everyone we talk to about this topic is super excited.</description>

                <abstract>This discussion will start with a brief summary on the history of repair initiatives. We can report about our personal repair activities during the pandemic. Subsequently, I'll outline the achievements of the right to repair movement and we can discuss ideas for the future.</abstract>
                <description>During a peak in public interest, the repair café movement was caught by the covid pandemic.
Many local initiatives adapted quickly and opened online repair consultation hours. In the german-speaking countries, a monthly central online repair café was established. I'll give a lessons-learned about the experiences and limits of these online activities.
The political right to repair movement has brought many interesting improvements, for example the french repairability index or the European ecodesign directive.  I'll talk about them and what else is to be expected in the near future.
This is in interactive discussion format, so ideally I'll only present a few facts and guide through topics while the audience chimes in with their personal experiences and questions.</description>

                <abstract>The HomeComputerMuseum's idea originated in 2016 and opened the doors in 2018. Since then, we faced several challenges but we came out on the other end and became one of the largest museums about computers with an award-winning social impact, an enormous social network, collaborations over the whole world and even are of essential importance to the Dutch government. The talk is about the original concept, how we build it to what it is now.</abstract>
                <description>The original concept of the HomeComputerMuseum is a hands-on computermuseum dedicated to the home computer or connected computers. Because a museum is a terrible businessplan I decided to create a few services, like repairs, selling overstock and reading old media. For this could not be done by one person, I decided to have people with autism help me by simply not putting a label on them. The businessplan was created and eventually a building was rented. The entire museum is physically built in 7 days (not even kidding) and we were off to a very rough start and even balancing on the edge of bankruptcy. However, we managed to stay afloat and we even moved to a much better and bigger building where we enjoyed for a full month before corona hit the museum. As an unsubsidized museum and without big sponsors we were faced a brand new challenge. But we overcame and grew stronger than ever.... (and then there's plenty of story to tell more).</description>

                <abstract>The current digital educational system is dominated by tech giants. Fundamental rights, like the privacy, freedom and sovereignty of children, parents and educators are insufficiently secured. Ed-tech is mainly closed source and full of vendor lockins. Products are either overpriced, harvesting data, or both. The time to replace surveillance capitalist based Ed-tech by ethical open source alternatives is now. And our coalition for fair digital education is going to do it.</abstract>
                <description>Private companies do not have the same interests as public institutions like schools. Schools do not have the time, knowledge or budget to hack their own IT environment together. Hence, BigTech and Ed-Tech fix this problem for schools, by offering services that have a very low price tag in euro's, but the actual payment is in data: meta data, "service"-data and user-data. DPIA you say? *(Detailed Privacy Impact Analysis)* That will achieve sort-of-legally compliant services at max. If only the authorities would actually bite, but alas, enforcement is lax, and four years of GDPR and the IT environment in schools is still riddled with privacy risks. Essential online services are out-of-scope of the DPIA's and purposes like "product improvement" (read: feeding AI and machine learning algorithms) is GDPR-Okay. If you or your kid goes to a 'Google school' and is forced to use a Chromebook, you'll be producing data to train Google, and you will be trained to love Google services. Consequently children won't develop core digital skills or a critical attitude toward digital services.

Thus, there is a huge gap between core values of big tech companies versus public values in the educational system. Therefore, enforcement to make Big Tech embrace those public values will never be effective. ​​​​​​​That is why we need to build a school IT environment based upon public values: transparent, open source, privacy-by-design, decentralized, fair and respecting our digital sovereignty. Our coalition for fair digital education is going to build this. This is a huge project and a lot of work, so join us.</description>

                <abstract>Using cryptography can give you easy assurances, keep data confidential and keep prying eyes from stuff where they should not be.

However it's not magic.
This talk is intended for programmers, users and software designers.

This talk is about hardcore mathematics while you should not have to understand what the mathematics are but what they do.

What does cryptography do: encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify.
How are certificates used in cryptogaphy and why are they totally not a magical thing.

It covers what cool hardware is available, open design and open source, hardware tokens and how to use TPM for cool features.

And last but not least: it contains best practices and warnings. After this talk you might be able to see what's snakeoil and what is real.</abstract>
                <description>== NFT's are a scam. If you are into crypto-bullshit please stay away. ==

Cryptography seems like magic anytime you at first look at it.
In the past years I have been helping a lot of projects and customers with my more-than-basic knowledge about applied cryptography.

I'll talk about:
* What is cryptography (basic math)
  - encryption
  - decryption
  - digital signatures
  - digital signature verification
* What can it do for you?
  - Deliver security
  - Deliver privacy
  - Deliver dataloss
* When to use encryption
  - what cryptography do you want to build (hint: none)
  - what cryptography do you want to use (a- or symetrical encryption).
  - how do you do key management
  - where to find the best practices
* About hardware
  - Provide security
  - Provide speed
  - HSM, TPM, processor and other acceleration
* Standards
  - The good, the bad, the ugly
  - Old ones
  - New ones
  - Very special ones
* Limitations and workarounds
* Software
  - How to avoid OpenSSL
* This all in random() order. Random = 4</description>

                <description>TIC-80 fantasy console Byte Jam is a friendly competition to livecode a demo in a relaxed atmosphere. This can take an hour or more depending on the inspiration and time needed of the participants. You could follow the suggested random chosen topic or do your own thing. 

TIC-80 is a fantasy console with limited resources like 240x136 pixels display, 16 color palette, 256 8x8 color sprites, 4 channel sound , etc. This gives the TIC-80 a very retro look and feel.

This byte jam is a good representation of the demoscene, where coders/hackers with very limited resources in hard or software make stunning audio and visual effects. In Europe the demoscene got status of cultural heritage in Finland, Germany and Polen and requested for Netherlands and other countries.

                <abstract>This workshop will introduce upagekite, an open source micro-framework for building dynamic, public webapps using Micropython on the low-cost ESP32 system-on-a-chip.

This session will start with participants plugging the ESP32 (an ESP32-CAM devkit) into their laptops for the first time, and by the end of it they will have a running web server on the public Internet - running in a few hundred KB of RAM on a chip that costs only a few euro.</abstract>
                <description>The ESP32 is a low-cost system-on-a-chip with built-in support for bluetooth and WiFi.

Although heavily resource constrained, with only a  few hundred KB of RAM, it is possible to run Micropython on these devices and expose a live webserver: not just to the local network, but to the public web using open-source Pagekite reverse proxies.

Topics covered in the workshop will include:

1. Flashing the latest version of Micropython to the chip
2. Uploading custom Python code
3. Creating a simple, dynamic webapp which interacts with peripherals, such as a camera or GPIO
4. Exposing the webapp to the public web
5. Security concerns and constraints

Advanced topics which may be covered, depending on time and interest:

* Conserving RAM by "freezing" custom Python code into the Micropython binary
* Creating a captive portal for configuring the device on a new network

Workshop requirements:

* A laptop: if running Windows, please have WSL or a Linux VM with access to the USB ports
* A data-capable micro-USB cable
* Please be familiar with basic use of command-line git and Python
* *Optional:* Bring your own ESP32 dev-board

Participants are welcome to bring their own ESP32s, but there will also be a few (max 25) ESP32-CAM modules handed out as giveaways (yes, you can keep it if you want), on a first-come, first-served basis. If we run out of chips, consider working in teams.</description>

                <abstract>Protect our patients from healthcare hacks! The increasing availability of telemetric medical devices has great potential to improve patient care. Yet, smart medical devices are hackable and previous case studies have described the life threatening implications of healthcare hacks. We invite you to a workshop run by doctors who are looking for your input on a series of commonly used telemetric medical technologies. Help us improve patient care by exploring potential vulnerabilities and solutions.</abstract>
                <description>Telemetric medical devices can enhance patient care by improving symptom detection and disease treatment through the delivery of timely and responsive interventions (e.g., wireless glucose monitoring devices for diabetic patients). Yet, the increasing adoption of wireless medical devices in healthcare settings and the consumer environment puts patients at risk of ‘healthcare hacks’. 

We present a number of wireless medical devices currently in use and ask you to consider the vulnerabilities of these technologies to hack attacks:
1. Diabetes glucose sensors
2. Hearing aids
3. Cardiac Monitors
4. Pain relief voltage devices
5. Virtual Patient Beds

Each of these devices connect remotely to a monitoring device, exposing them to malicious digital manipulation. So far, two case studies have described the vulnerabilities of these systems. One report described the remote hijacking of an insulin pump and another described the manipulation of an implanted cardiac device [1-3]. Increasingly, research is describing the security and privacy risks of telemetric and implanted medical devices to patients. In particular, ‘closed loop’ systems that alter device settings based on real-time physiological signals do not require clinician or patient input, and are therefore particularly vulnerable to unnoticed manipulation. Without proper security, smart medical devices are breachable and can have life-threatening consequences for the patient. 

We invite you to our workshop to discuss, in short groups, the listed devices and their vulnerability to manipulation.  As medical doctors, we will highlight the range of clinical syndromes which may arise from these hacks and will discuss how they may be recognised in clinical settings. 

Lastly, we will consider the vulnerability of the healthcare concept of ‘The Virtual Patient’. Due to high hospital occupancy following the COVID19 pandemic, ‘Virtual Beds’ - which allow physicians to monitor patients in the community - have been suggested as an alternative policy for relieving pressure from healthcare services. The management of the ‘virtual patient’ relies heavily on telemetry devices and medical database systems. We will discuss the vulnerability of the specific devices listed above, in addition to the wider concept of ‘virtual patient care’.

Questions for workshop participants would include:
(i) Vulnerabilities: How would you hack a smart medical device or what attacks is it likely to encounter? 
(ii) Defense: What are device vulnerabilities and what options could improve the security of these devices? 
(iii) Ethics: What are the arguments for and against these devices being used in healthcare?

                <abstract>Trauma is a powerful force that affects an individual’s ability to cope and navigate through their life. A human at their worst mental state, is going to interact with a system in drastically different ways than a human at their best. How can technologists design new systems with these psychological vulnerabilities that many humans have in mind? In this workshop, we’ll be using a systems innovation, design and psychology lens to demonstrate practical frameworks to addressing the how.</abstract>
                <description>There’s a growing awareness in Western society about the negative impacts that technology has on our lives. Parallel to that, there is a growing acknowledgement that mental health and wellbeing is important. But for any prominent change to happen in a positive direction, these discourses cannot stay evolving in parallel - they need to come together and inform each other. Trauma and its impacts on human psychology are an all-pervasive force that impact humans on a micro and macro level. It only makes sense that the same force would replicate itself in technology. From the alarming rate of depression in social media use to addictive and detrimental financial decision-making in cryptocurrency trading, technology has a significant impact on human behaviour, melding in and perpetuating pre-existing vulnerabilities we have. But how would we map this complex, slightly abstract idea out in a practical way? What would a trauma-informed system look like? Or may we dare to dream of moving forward from being stuck in cycles of trauma? Using a systems-innovation framework, paired with a value-driven design lens and an understanding of trauma from research and our own journeys in it, we’d like to share with you a multidisciplinary design lens that acknowledges trauma as a significant actor within it. The workshop will include our a recollection of own experiences in the climate innovation, humanitarian sector and decentralised technology field. We will invite participants to reflect upon how they interact within systems, mapping out the relationship between complexity and unintended psychological consequences, and how to ultimately re-imagine a different world.</description>

                <abstract>Hacking = playing. Let me take you along in this playshop to discover and experience the power of a playful mind and the science behind it.
In this Playshop we will Play ourselves a way through a lot of the scientific proof about the positive effects of embedding it in your day to day life. Playful people are more creative, have more fun and are overall more happy and joyful. Come to this session and unlearn this stupid idea that playing is for children!</abstract>
                <description>Playing is proven to be crucial for learning, innovating and mentoring. And thus a fundamental tool for any hacker or maker out there.
I rediscovered playing, made my job out of it and I would love to take you on a journey with an inspirational, interactive and pragmatic session to do so too (or even more)

There was a time in your life where you stopped playing. Or you probably didn’t. What’s up with the idea that playing is childish? Why do we ignore all the great scientific proof that playing is the best way to learn? This is a personal story about finding out what I need to do, combined with evidence based knowledge.

The take aways of this playshop are: 
– 7 most important scientific reasons why you should encourage playing in a professional setting. 
– The difference between playing and gaming. 
– 3 tips to start tomorrow. 
– A shitload of games which we will play and you can use yourself &#128578;
(I even have a CYBER! Game!) 

I rediscovered playing and I would love to take you on a journey with an inspirational and pragmatic session to do so too!

                <abstract>Scratch is a awesome language and tool to get started with programming in a playful and creative way. This workshop is intended for complete beginners as well as those who already have some experience with Scratch. 

---

Scratch is een geweldige taal en een programma om aan de slag te gaan met programmeren door een beetje creatief te klooien. Deze workshop is bedoeld voor zowel beginners als mensen die al wat ervaring met Scratch hebben.</abstract>
                <description>You'll learn the basics by creating an example game. After that, use your creativity and problem solving skills to make the game unique with your own rules and graphics. Ask around for help or to get advice on how to add a next challenge.

If you already have some experience with Scratch, you can also learn how to create beautifully colored fractal curves. In a few steps, you'll create Scratch code that will use itself (recursion) to draw a pattern that has the same properties, no matter how much you zoom in.

##### Practical information

- The workshop will be a mix of English and Dutch, and you can read a bit in both languages. Händen und Füßen will be used if necessary.
- You need to bring your own computer or tablet that connects to the internet. Don't forget to charge the battery and bring someone to help you with carrying and using it if necessary.
- You can use Scratch with almost any computer or tablet that runs an internet browser. Try: https://scratch.mit.edu/create. Bigger, brighter, upright screens work best.
- Scratch was designed for ages 8 and up. It could be good to bring someone to help you out. Solving programming challenges together can be a lot of fun.

### Nederlands

Leer de basis door een voorbeeldspelletje te maken. Gebruik daarna je creativiteit en vindingrijkheid om je spel uniek te maken met eigen regels, afbeeldingen en animaties. Vraag rond voor hulp of om advies te krijgen om een volgende uitdaging aan je spel toe te voegen.

Als je al wat ervaring met Scratch hebt kan je ook leren hoe je prachtig gekleurde fractals kan maken. In een paar stappen maak je Scratch-code die zichzelf gebruikt (recursie) om een patroon te tekenen die steeds dezelfde eigenschappen heeft, hoe ver je ook inzoomt.

##### Praktische informatie

- De workshop zal een mix van Engels en Nederlands zijn, en je kan iets lezen in beide talen.
- Neem je eigen computer of tablet met internetverbinding mee. Vergeet 'm niet op te laden, en neem iemand mee die je helpt met dragen en gebruiken als dat nodig is.
- Scratch werkt op bijna elke computer of tablet met een internetbrowser. Probeer: https://scratch.mit.edu/create. Grotere, heldere schermen die rechtop staan werken het beste.
- Scratch is ontworpen voor 8 jaar en ouder. Het kan helpen om iemand mee te nemen om je te assisteren. Samen programmeeruitdagingen oplossen kan erg leuk zijn.</description>

                <abstract>The vision of a quantum internet is to enhance existing Internet technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on Earth. Such a quantum internet will—in synergy with the “classical” internet that we have today—connect quantum information processors in order to achieve unparalleled capabilities that are provably impossible by using only classical information, such as distributing encryption keys secured by the laws of quantum mechanics, more efficient distributed agreement, or private delegated quantum computation. The first quantum entanglement networks have been realised in a lab including a software and network protocol stack for executing platform-independent applications. In this workshop we will introduce the basic concepts underpinning the quantum internet and take you through developing your own quantum network application running on a (for now) simulated quantum internet using the Quantum Network Explorer platform.</abstract>
                <description>This workshop consists of two parts;

First, a basic introduction to quantum networks. Here, I will introduce the basic building blocks of a quantum internet: quantum bits (qubits), entanglement, and quantum repeaters. I will then explain the quantum mechanical phenomena that enable greater security for communication and how entanglement is a fundamentally new resource for distributed tasks and computation.

Secondly, to illustrate these concepts, I will take the audience through an implementation of a simple Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) application whereby Alice and Bob create a quantum-secured secret key which they can use to encrypt their communication. This will be done in Python using the tools available on the Quantum Network Explorer.

**Pre-requisites**: You need a machine with Linux and Python &lt;= 3.9 (some of the packages have not been updated to 3.10). You may use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (Bash on Ubuntu) if you have a Windows machine. MacOS is in principle supported, but often causes issues due to certain dependencies that do not work on MacOS. In this case, you are advised to have Linux installed in a virtual machine.</description>

                <abstract>Human interactions can be messy - especially in groups. Often we unconsciously follow bad protocols. Consciously thinking about how you interact in groups makes a huge difference. Come and experience some simple recipes for structuring interactions that include and involve everyone.</abstract>
                <description>Human interactions can be messy - especially in groups. Who doesn't know the situation where the loudest/most eloquent/charismatic person gets to dominate the conversation or the HIPPO effect. Or we have battles of two opponents/opinions, with the rest of the group watching in terror or shutting off. 
How about that awkward silence in a big group where nobody wants to go first, the terror of going in a circle and being expected to be able to contribute at just that moment when it is your turn? and let's not forget you might want to include more than 5-8 people in an interaction. Sitting in a circle and distributing time equally just won't work.

There is a better way, and it is easy and fun.

In this highly interactive workshop, y'all get to experience and practice simple recipes for structuring interactions that include and involve everyone. 

Come as you are and experience some interaction. Or learn more about the principles and micro structures for these "group interaction recipes" at liberatingstructures.com.</description>

                <abstract>The Interplanetary Filesystem is an API and network for locating and fetching content-addressed data. This workshop will provide an interactive space to build applications using content addressed data, and provide guidance on potential decentralized answers to some common types of communication patterns.</abstract>
                <description>Do you want to build a website or service without needing centrally hosted or managed infrastructure?

This workshop will guide you through first creating and hosting a static website stored in the [Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io), and then explore the possibilities for active communication patterns that can be realized in a decentralized fashion. We hope to shed some light into what's possible today, what's actively being worked on, and where help is needed.

Content addressed data is able to address a large range of needs today, and offers valuable integrity and ownership guarantees when compared with the traditional client-server model. While IPFS has made large strides in usability, there remain many places where the mental model is different from a client-server model. This workshop will provide grounding in how IPFS functions and can be employed to build a decentralized service.</description>

                <abstract>Let's talk about our projects and surroundings, and how their setup may be discrimnating.
Let's find barriers, and think about ways of to remove or bypass them. 
Whether it's about your hackspace being way too white and able-bodied, your IT project being too male-dominated, or your leftist intiative somehow being very non-working class: let's find a way to figure this out and make your surroudings more diverse and equitable.</abstract>
                <description>The target group for this workshop is primarily people working in/with tech, and there is no need to know sociology theories to keep up. 

This talk covers the work that I have done for my master's thesis. I looked at how (in Human Computer Interaction) projects tackled different forms of discrimination not by the stuff that they created, but rather by how they went about it. 
From writing proposals to deciding on which methods to use (and how), to documenting the work afterwards: there's lots of things we can do to be more inclusionary. 

In this workshop, I will present a set of recommendations that I have created for the purpose of helping non-social sciences people be better in including people that are different to them (tech people still are a rather homogenous group of white, affluent, cis non-inter men). After the presentation, we will apply said recommendations to whichever projects the participants would like to -- ideally, they bring their own (with a short explanation), or we come up with some fictional setting.</description>

                <abstract>Last year we developed an Ubuntu Touch Application Development training and printed a training book.
In this workshop our trainer Felix and assistant Terence will help you with your first steps developing for Ubuntu Touch, right on your own laptop!
We have material to fill 2 days, so it will never get boring.
If you already have Docker pre-installed on your laptop the startup should be quick.
The first 30 participants will receive their own copy of the Ubuntu Touch App dev book for free!</abstract>
                <description>The last year we had a team of professionals combined with community members to work on developing app development training material for the UBports mobile device OS.
In this workshop we will use the course material we have developed the past year and help people to create apps that run on the Ubuntu Touch mobile device OS.
We will start with a simple grocery-list application and take it from there.
Time permitting we will add making rest calls and doing stuff with media to the contents. 
We have material to fill 2 days, so it will never get boring.</description>

                <abstract>[Gopass](https://www.gopass.pw/) is a password manager based on PGP or age, that allows you to easily manage your passwords but also your team's passwords in a way that's fully transparent, easy to backup, easy to monitor and easy to use. It supports hardware tokens such as Yubikeys, it allows you to setup versioning using git easily and supports multiple "stores" from different remotes.
It integrates very nicely with a command line based approach and dmenu plus xdotools make it a breeze to use (unless you prefer to rely on the dedicated browser extension).</abstract>
                <description>[Gopass](https://www.gopass.pw/) is a password manager based on PGP (or age), that allows you to easily manage your passwords but also your team's passwords in a way that's fully transparent, easy to backup, easy to monitor and easy to use. It supports hardware tokens such as Yubikeys, it allows you to setup versioning using git easily and supports multiple "stores" from different remotes.
It integrates very nicely with a command line based approach and dmenu plus xdotools make it a breeze to use (unless you prefer to rely on the dedicated browser extension).

In this workshop, we will walk through the "password issue", the hope for a better future and see what are our best options nowadays. 

Finally, we will go through the setup of the password manager of your choice, I highly recommend choosing Gopass, learn about good practices with passwords and (if you brought yours) setup your password store using a hardware token if possible.

Bring you own laptop and a **USB stick** (for proper backup and recovery purposes). Notice that running Linux is the best way to fully benefit from Gopass, but MacOS and Windows are also (somewhat) supported. Please, if you have one (even already in use for something else), bring your Yubikey 4+ with you, since you can easily increase your password store's security using it.

You can also come if you'd like to enhance your existing password store setup, or if you need help migrating your existing password store over to Gopass.</description>

                <abstract>Using a DIY conductive dough/clay you will create your own creatures and adorn them with working (basic) electronics like LED's and buzzers. Always wanted to create a snail with blinking lights? Or a lovely heart with lights? This is your chance! This workshop is aimed at kids (4 - 10yrs)  Supervision of an adult is required. The dough uses food coloring and is made using basic food ingredients. Food allergies? Check the recipe in our repository before taking part!</abstract>
                <description>Using nothing but basic kitchen ingredients (flour, salt, lemon juice, vegetable oil)  we will create a conductive dough (clay) in different colors (using food coloring). Combined with a battery pack (6Volts) the dough is conductive enough due to the salt and lemon juice (and therefor also not edible) to power LED's and a simple buzzer. 

You will be able to sculpt  your own creations. Add basic electronics like LED's and buzzers and make them come alive! This workshop is aimed at kids (4 - 10yrs)  Supervision of an adult is required. Food allergies? Check the recipe in our repository before taking part!</description>

                <language>en</language>
                <abstract>This **workshop** is for **girls and boys** age 7-18.   
Programming is not difficult! Here we learn from each other and the coaches how to program by doing it ourselves.  
We bring a range of robotics: Makeblock Mbot, Mbot2, Ultimate, Grove, Ozobot, Makey Makey, Microbit with Maqueen.  
There is only one rule: **Above all: be cool!**</abstract>
                <description>### About Coderdojo:

Coderdojo organises free programming clubs, called "_Dojos_". At these Dojos girls and boys, the _Ninjas_, learn to program, make websites, apps and develop games.  
The dojos are run by volunteers: _Coaches_ to trigger the spark in the Ninjas and _Cooks_ to handle practical stuff like registration, snacks, drinks.  
The stars of the show are the Ninjas who meet equal minded participants to collaborate and to show each other what they are working on.  
Coderdojo shows that programming is not only for nerds. Our coders build super nice projects and are the ultimate example that technology can be fun.  
We have one rule: **"Above all: be cool!"**.

### Practical Information:

This workshop is for girls and boys age 7-18 (experience with Scratch will give you a headstart, others will get a quick Scratch Intro).   
If you are younger than 12, you are best accompanied by a parent.  
Parents can stick around for the sparkling atmosphere and to help volunteering.  
We bring different robotics: 
- Makeblock Mbot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hQtdYd5i-Y
- Makeblock Mbot 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxpoP175mOU
- Makeblock Ultimate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noutjGbBF2U
- Grove https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqsObxK0wDM
- Ozobot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm_H8HXWFZ4
- Makey Makey https://youtu.be/70Ykn2k5LOg
- Microbit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuza5WXiMkc
- Microbit with Maqueen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sAHwsOEKsg

It is a **must** if parents **join half an hour before the end** to attend **the show and tell**.

You can bring a laptop. Coaches will help with installing the needed software.  
If you cannot bring a laptop, indicate this to the organisation and we will foresee one for you.</description>

                <abstract>In this workshop, we will learn how to assemble tiny parts on circuit boards by building an electronic touch-activated purring kitten. Anyone can do it. Yes, even you who never touched anything electronic before. Takes 120mins, 20€/kit, avoid caffeine immediately before. Max 10 participants per session, sign up on PAPER at the Hardware Hacking Area.</abstract>
                <description>Takes about two hours. Basic workshop. No prior knowledge needed. Materials cost 20€ per kit.

We are going to build an electronic kitten using tiny tiny SMD parts. It will purr when you touch it right and hiss when you touch it wrong. It's going to work. You will learn how to make your hands not shake at all ever. You will learn how to activate your builtin precision positioning superpowers.

For people afraid of surface mount assembly/rework. You know those tiny little components in modern electronic devices? It's both possible and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you how!

Think you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s? Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is minimal and you probably already have it. We'll learn the answer to THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no longer need to be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before the workshop, because shaky hands are a disadvantage.

The workshop kit costs 20€. Please SIGN UP ON THE PAPER LIST at the Hardware Hacking Area. PLEASE BE ON TIME!</description>

                <abstract>Ankle monitors are devices typically used by law enforcement to track offenders, have you ever wondered how they work - which potential vulnerabilities they have or where to buy one ( or many )? This talk is about hacking electronic ankle monitors built by various Chinese manufacturers - and the protocols and software they use.</abstract>
                <description>Ankle monitors are devices used by law enforcement to track offenders - typically ones on house arrest. They contain various sensors and GPS, WiFi, Cellular and sometimes RF communication to transmit data and determine their position. 

This talk will go into detail for various brands on how they communicate with their servers - potential vulnerabilities and ways to escape/avoid detection. This talk concerns Chinese vendors of ankle monitors - but the processes are applicable to different brands and types as well. I will discuss how I developed a server which can be used with 4 vendors of these devices - and how I got the protocol documents for each of them through a bit of social engineering.

The focus will be on the technical details of how your location is determined - which fallbacks are used in case locating falls - and how data is communicated to the server - and the security implications of all of this. Some of devices are used by small nations to track for instance immigrants for COVID tracking - we will discuss the implications of this.</description>

                <abstract>Electric vehicles present a real opportunity to take a step towards better designed, more reliable, and sustainable transport. Instead, electric cars have become nightmarishly complex gadgets whose limited lifespans will make them less sustainable than a diesel pickuptruck running on whale oil. This talk will explore the problem, and make a few suggestions as to what could be done about it.</abstract>
                <description>I want my next car to have an electric motor, I want it to push the boundaries of what is capable with a battery and I want it to be an automotive tour de force that represents a real advance over my gasoline car in terms of lifetime sustainability. The switch to electric cars represents an opportunity like no other to deliver a new type of car that doesn’t carry the baggage of what has gone before, but what I see in the electric cars available to me just doesn't live up to that dream. The car industry now makes cars that don't rust and don't wear out, so for planned obsolescence they now rely on technological complexity to ensure they reach the scrap heap long before their promise of true sustainability can be realised. This talk will attempt to deconstruct the problem, and look at how it might be remedied.</description>

                <abstract>DIVD researcher Jelle (aka SchizoDuckie) has a hobby. He likes to find credentials in places where they don't belong, like GitHub and Postman. And this hobby has gotten him into many places he should not have, like the Dutch Tax office and many larger company.

But, in February 2022 he found an account with an even bigger reach, an account who's abuse could mean trouble for our national critical infrastructure. His simple GitHub query uncovered a secret that could switch off a country, now what...</abstract>
                <description>While Jelle is enjoying his vacation his DIVD colleagues, Chris van 't Hof, Célistine Oosting and Frank Breedijk,  will present the story of one of the more significant vulnerabilities discovered by DIVD this year. The long windy but mostly slow and silent road to disclosure and remediation and how mitigation did not take away all the risks.
This talk digs into the, up to this point, untold story of case DIVD-2022-00009 and will include numbers "Doc" Brown will jealous of.</description>

                <abstract>We take a scenic tour through the origins of the UK train ticket, from the original BR specification in the 1970s through to modern replacements like mTickets, eTickets and ITSO. 

This is just a detour though, and we'll focus on the 'orange ticket' (RSP 9399/9599) - which continues to be a stalwart of the UK rail network. Surely they can't be that secure? After all, anyone can encode a magstripe - right? 

We'll take a look through the data encoded on these tickets, what interesting things you can do with them and maybe (assuming I've got it working by then) we'll be able to read and write our own!</abstract>

                <abstract>During the COVID19-pandemic the Netherlands turned to hackers to help them make digital solutions to fight the pandemic. Why was it? What does this do to a government body like ministry? What does this mean for privacy, security and the tech choices that are made?</abstract>
                <description>In 2020, when the pandemic started, scientists suggested to also digitally support fighting the pandemic. One of the suggestions was digitally supported contact tracing. After first asking the market for solutions the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport decided to self build open, privacy friendly, secure and accessible solutions with help of a large open source community.

When vaccinations became available and timeframes for building solutions were near impossible the next step was clear: get hackers involved. This isn’t just to stick to the values, but also to create solutions in ways that aren’t always common for governments. How do you hack processes and rules to create what some ministries called magic?

This talk will tell the inside hacker tale of the pandemic and show the dilemmas that were overcome. This is a story of hackers in a ministry at the heat of the moment.</description>

                <abstract>In this presentation, we will be updating the audience on the ongoing modernization efforts of the software developed inside The Tor Project -- the organization behind the most widely deployed anonymity network. We will look at upcoming features and changes to the core technology that drives the Tor network and why a Browser may no longer be the only product we have to provide for the user-base that is so crucial in need of Tor's anonymity properties for safe internet access.</abstract>
                <description>The Tor ecosystem is currently going through a more extensive modernization phase where we are simplifying our goals slightly to make space for larger projects that we find necessary.

This work includes implementing a new, more memory-safe Tor implementation in the Rust programming language named Arti. This work will make it easier for application developers to integrate their applications and benefit from the safety features that Tor can provide. 

Additionally, we will talk about some recent or upcoming changes to the network:

- Give a status update on deploying modern congestion control algorithms in the Tor network. This work should significantly enhance the performance barrier that most Tor users experience.
- The roadmap towards UDP support in the client and relay software. This work should allow more modern use-cases of the Tor software such as voice and video communication, WebRTC, and other protocols that leverage datagram-based data transfer.
- Move to more modern cryptography in Tor's protocols, including support for Post-quantum cryptography and why this is needed.
- Allowing Tor users to access the network using a VPN-like tunneling mechanism as an alternative to simply web-browsing and other socks5 enabled applications.</description>

                <abstract>Last year we won Pwn2Own by demonstrating remote code execution, using a chain of three vulnerabilities, on the then latest version of the Zoom client. In this talk we would like to share all details of the vulnerabilities we found and how we combined them into a fully working exploit.</abstract>
                <description>When the pandemic required everyone to work from home, we saw a huge growth on the video conferencing market. It was this movement that made the organisation behind the world famous Pwn2Own competition decide to add an 'Enterprise Communications' category to last year’s competition. Everyone who was able to successfully demonstrate a zero-day attack against Zoom or Microsoft Teams would be rewarded $200,000. We decided to take them up on this challenge and started researching Zoom. This resulted in a working remote exploit against the at the time latest version of Zoom that would give the attacker full control over the victim’s system (CVE-2021-34407).

During this talk, we will walk you through how we started our research, explain the vulnerabilities that were found and finally how those vulnerabilities were incorporated into the exploit that successfully performed the attack during the contest.</description>

                <description>I'll present Scientist Rebellion, an international group of scientists taking the scientific view of the climate emergency seriously, stepping away from writing yet another paper giving the same warnings and venturing into civil disobedience.

We've had worldwide (27 countries) actions and growing rapidly, as more scientists feel the necessity for society to do more (not just throwing more money at companies when they promise to be less polluting, but strict laws preventing such pollution levels).

                <abstract>Predictive policing is hip and happening. In the last few years we have seen a number of experiments with predictive policing in The Netherlands. How does that technology work? What were the outcomes of the experiments? And what is the legal status of a suspicion generated by a computer?</abstract>
                <description>"Predictive policing" is the name of a family of technology that use historical crime data to make predictions about future crimes (cue Minority Report). Police departments all over the world are very interested in this technology because it promises better results (more crimes prevented) at lower cost. In the Netherlands we have seen a number of experiments with predictive policing, and one of these systems (CAS) is currently being rolled out throughout the country. But how do these systems work? And how _well_ do they work? And what is actually the legal status of a suspicion generated by a computer? 

This talk will give discuss relevant predictive policing experiments in the Netherlands and abroad and will discuss the results of these experiments. The talk will also cover the legal status of suspicions generated by this technology in the Netherlands.</description>

                <abstract>IRMA is a system in which you are in control of sharing specific personal properties (aka attributes) such as your age, address and gender which are stored in the IRMA app on your phone. Technically, IRMA is a set of free and open source software projects implementing the Idemix attribute-based credential scheme. Although the Idemix credential system has been around for a while it is still relevant today. In this talk, we walk you through the crypto behind Idemix, explain how it works, why it is safe and give you the means to understand Gabi, the Go implementation of Idemix that is used in IRMA.</abstract>
                <description>Presentations on privacy products often focus on the principles of why we should want to protect our privacy and how the product does this from a birds-eye or user perspective. In case of IRMA, this focus would be on storing your attributes on your local device and on the information flow when the IRMA app is used.

However, in this talk we want to dig deeper, demonstrate the crypto behind the curtains and give you the means to reason why IRMA is a neat solution.

Note that the talk is very technical. We will cover the theory of the zero-knowledge proofs, the Camenisch-Lysyankaya signature and the Idemix credential verification, all so you can understand the Go implementation of the Gabi library. If time allows, we'll also cover IRMA-specific solutions such as the keyshare protocol and revocation.

We will cover a lot of ground very quickly but after this talk you will have an excellent starting point for truely understanding this anonymous credential system. Of course we'll provide you with follow-up material and are happy to chat some more after the talk with a beer or two.

Background knowledge that will help in understanding this talk:
- General understanding of public key cryptography, especially RSA (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsqqpO9R5Hc, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL7J8hPKEWY)
- Basic algebra, namely the laws of exponentiation
- Some context on IRMA (https://irma.app/docs/overview/)</description>

                <abstract>Governments should be radically more transparent. While calls for more open data and initiatives like the Open Government Partnership have existed for more than a decade, there is still much to be desired. Where do we stand? And, fun to imagine, where could and should we go?</abstract>
                <description>It is hard to have a perfect overview of the status of open government across the world. We at [Open State Foundation](https://openstate.eu/) focus mostly on accelerating digital transparency in the Netherlands. We will explain things like:

- Why is the **Handelsregister** (company register) still only fully accessible for those with a lot of money? 
- Why are **Wob-verzoeken** (Freedom of Information requests) on average not answered within the legal deadline?
- How transparent are the **external meetings of ministers** and who do they talk to?

On the other hand we show why the Netherlands is a great place if you want to know how your municipalities spend their money or want to access national statistics.

Still there is much to learn from other countries:
- **How does Norway manage their information so well** that they respond to Freedom of Information requests much faster?
- What country has **a minister that deals in the most open way with lobbyist**? 
- Can governments produce **modern open source software**? 
These examples can show us a future of a digitally transparent democracy.

We end the talk by opening up the floor to the audience and love to hear about positive examples of transparent forms of governments around the world.</description>

                <abstract>Hardware attacks on security relevant components, such as fault injection, have been known for decades and have been shown to be successful on a wide range of devices ranging from general purpose microcontrollers to dedicated security engines. In this work we give an overview of different methods used for fault injection and the effectiveness of these methods. We discuss electromagnetic fault injection in more detail. Most of the published research focuses on attacking low performance secure devices. However, we present the results of electromagnetic fault injection on a modern multicore system on chip running at gigahertz speed and discuss its effectiveness.</abstract>
                <description>In this presentation we discuss hardware attacks in general, their use cases, and real-world examples. We then discuss electromagnetic fault injection in detail. We compare the results of the previous research on microcontrollers and secure elements to more modern high performance system on chip devices. We discuss relevant features of modern Arm systems on chip and answer the two main questions of this research. Are electromagnetic fault injection attacks applicable and efficient when applied to software running at gigahertz speed on a modern multicore system on a chip? And to what extent does the operating frequency change the effectiveness of electromagnetic fault injection attacks?</description>

                <abstract>Nowadays, when a user wants to authenticate mostly centralized systems, such as DigiD in the Netherlands, are utilized. Extreme events can impact the reliability of such systems. Decentralized, and more privacy-preserving systems, such as [IRMA](https://irma.app/) can help to build more reliable authentication infrastructures. With IRMA, a user can store signed attributes, such as their full name or address, within the IRMA mobile app. Subsequently, the user can disclose a subset of her attributes to parties during an authentication session. The [Verifiable Credentials (VC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) standard helps to make such systems interoperable, that is, users can use attributes across different credential systems. With a proof of concept, we show how to make IRMA VC-compliant.</abstract>
                <description>During extreme events, such as power outages or big floods, centralized systems are especially vulnerable as their availability can be impacted. This could result in that the whole system is unusable. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop decentralized infrastructures, as one is not dependent on centralized components.

Digital authentication nowadays is mostly done via centralized systems, such as DigiD, the authentication system of governmental services in the Netherlands. Every authentication session goes through a central authority, which makes the system centralized. Additionally, from a privacy-perspective, an issue is that such a system can keep track on which sites users authenticate. To achieve more system reliability and more user privacy, it is desirable to develop authentication systems that are working in a more decentralized manner.

One existing solution to this challenge is [IRMA](https://irma.app/). IRMA stands for I Reveal My Attributes and is developed by the Dutch non-profit organization [Privacy By Design](https://privacybydesign.foundation/). A central element of IRMA is a mobile app, which the foundation promotes as a digital passport on your own mobile device. Users can collect signed attributes, a set of attributes is called a credential, from authoritative parties. An attribute is for instance, your Dutch BSN, full name, or email address. IRMA protects the privacy of individuals by letting the individuals decide which attributes they want to disclose to whom, and by implementing advanced cryptography, including zero-knowledge proof techniques. Consequently, the receiving party can validate the authenticity of the disclosed credentials without the need to contact the party that issued the credentials.

[Verifiable Credentials (VC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) is a standard developed by the W3C. It provides a data model and a syntax aiming to make credential systems interoperable, for instance, it can enable users to disclose credentials issued by one system to another system.

Currently, IRMA can only be used within the IRMA ecosystem, that is, among servers and mobile apps that use the IRMA attributes. However, it would be desirable that people are able to use such advanced technologies and authentic attributes on the entire web across different systems. This avoids that people need different apps to be used, that could contain the same attributes, with different systems. Our research shows that it is possible to make IRMA VC-compliant via a proof of concept. Subsequently, through VCs, IRMA attributes are available for servers and apps outside the IRMA ecosystem. Similarly, other credentials can become universally verifiable.

As decentralized systems become increasingly more available, governments and other organizations can utilize reliable and privacy protecting authentication widely. This benefits everyone – even and especially during extreme events.</description>

                <title>Programming microcontrollers in Go using TinyGo</title>

                <abstract>Go is often thought of as a server programming language, especially one used for microservices. However, I argue that it can also be a good language for much smaller systems: microcontrollers. Especially with the Internet of Things there is a need for a language that is safer, easier to use (harder to misuse) and easier to build and test.</abstract>
                <description>For many years, C has been the dominant language in the embedded world and especially microcontrollers. Almost all embedded systems are written in C. The last few years this has been changing, with new languages being used for this purpose:

  * [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/embedded) has seen rapid growth in embedded systems with its focus on safety and expressiveness. It is in fact a great replacement for C, as it is just as low level and efficient as C but without all the footguns. However, many people find this language hard to learn.
  * Another language that's sometimes used is Python, in the form of [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/). This is in fact what powers the SHA2017 and MCH2022 badges. While the project is an amazing accomplishment, it still suffers from the fact that the language is interpreted and there are limits to how fast it can be.
  * Some people have also used other languages, such as [Lua](https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/release/), [JavaScript](https://www.espruino.com/), [Oberon](https://www.astrobe.com/), [Forth](https://hackaday.com/2017/01/27/forth-the-hackers-language/), [Ada](https://blog.adacore.com/ada-on-the-microbit), and probably others. I'm not aware of a language that got much further than experimental or very specific uses.
  * Then there is [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/), which is a new compiler for the Go language and primarily targets baremetal embedded systems and WebAssembly. This is what I will talk about.

TinyGo is a new compiler for the Go programming language. Its goal is to implement the Go language specification, be able to compile most of the Go standard library, but still optimize well enough so that binaries can run on a range of large and small embedded systems. It optimizes much more aggressively than the main Go implementation and the resulting binaries are able to run on systems ranging from the Arduino Uno, to the BBC micro:bit, to the MCH2022 badge with an ESP32 chip. I believe TinyGo offers most of the ease-of-use benefits of interpreted languages while providing most of the performance benefits of languages such as C.

In this talk, I will cover what kinds of problems C can cause, why Go can be a great fit on embedded systems, an explanation of some optimizations that it does that help lower its code size and RAM consumption, and some examples of projects written using TinyGo. Oh, and of course some demos.</description>

                <abstract>Payment Service Directive (PSD2) is a fairly recent directive in Europe when it comes to electronic payments. For most of us this has happened invisibly. Although this new directive creates a lot of opportunities for fintech companies it also puts the privacy of tenths of millions of people in the hands of private companies. This talk will discuss the opportunities this will provide within Europe both for Fintech's... and scammers.</abstract>
                <description>In 2020 the Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) has become the directive governing banking in Europe. This means that for financial transactions between businesses, persons and banks a new European-wide payment system is available.
While before PSD2 in order to be able to act as a Payment Service Provider (PSP) you needed to be certified by the local central bank, now with PSD2 this is no longer necessary. This means all transaction data for an IBAN number going back up to years can be queried by commercial parties investing a few hundred euro’s. An example will be shown how easy it is to overlook giving consent for this data exchange and how to revoke this consent.
This talk will discuss the opportunities this new directive will provide EU residents, but will also show what implications this has in terms of privacy and how it enables scammers to automate scams.</description>

                <abstract>How should we live together? How do we make a complex, interdependent, infrastructural society less exploitive?  In this talk, we'll try to frame questions, if not answers, grounded in the context of the political changes required to mitigate and survive climate change, global fascism, and hypercapitalism.</abstract>
                <description>This talk starts from two threads.  First, the common understanding of "freedom" derives from the institution of slavery.  Looking at alternate definitions provides the foundation for rethinking the building blocks of society and human interaction.  Second, climate change represents an immediate existential threat to human civilization, but mitigating it is no longer a question of technology — only of collective will.

If we insist on maintaining existing structures of ownership and inequality, we significantly reduce our chance of survival.  However, these questions of freedom, ownership, and equity aren't just political questions, they're directly encoded in the infrastructure we all rely on to survive — that same infrastructure that we currently need to replace, almost wholesale.

In reality, any path to survival will imply a muddle of adaptation, mitigation, replacement, and elimination, both of infrastructural components and of elements of the social contract and its governance systems.  Harm reduction is more important and more probable than ideologically perfect revolutions (or even evolutions).  However, plausible visions of the future are a critical ingredient for the hope we need to continue the work, and will also directly shape that work.

Most folks who live in ownership societies (almost everyone, now) find the idea of moving away from an ownership model terrifying, because it means giving up those things that give them a sense of security.  Understanding the emotional interiority of life in a post-ownership society can change that, and understanding the dynamics of different freedoms can help us understand how we might get there.

As people who build infrastructure, we can play with the social models our infrastructure encodes — and have been doing so for decades.  Likewise, we can (and have been) rebuilding pieces of the social contracts that shape our personal lives.  This talk aims to leave you with new questions and new directions for that work.</description>

                <abstract>I want a Web where CDNs are unnecessary.

Where different organizations, different website operators, can help each other out by hosting assets for each others' websites, thus spreading the load across many orgs in solidarity, instead of centralizing it in gatekeepers.

I believe I might slowly be getting to a point of having a decent answer to that question. No blockchain required.</abstract>
                <description>What if I told you the [code for this is already mostly there](https://gitlab.com/rysiekpl/libresilient/)?

All major browsers support Service Workers and Subresource Integrity, which means we can have a piece of JS that:
1. only gets updated from the original domain
2. handles all requests for the website
3. routes these requests to the original domain, or hits third party endpoints when the original domain is unavailable for whatever reason
4. has ways of distributing and checking Subresource Integrity on any fetched resource.

And we do!

Points 1. and 2. are assured by Service Workers API, so browsers enforce that.

Point 3. can be achieved with [LibResilient's the alt-fetch plugin](https://gitlab.com/rysiekpl/libresilient/-/blob/master/plugins/alt-fetch.js).

Point 4. is the job of [LibResilient's signed-integrity plugin](https://gitlab.com/rysiekpl/libresilient/-/blob/master/plugins/signed-integrity.js).

This is all very PoC. Documentation is lacking or non-existent. But it's already there, ready to be tested and improved.</description>

                <description>My journey to find vulnerabilities in macOS. During 2020 and 2021 I found two major vulnerabilities from macOS. In this presentation I walk you through the whole exploit chain to compromise users' sensitive data with one click.

I will walk you through how I solved the following steps:
- Fundamentals how I find vulnerabilities
- Basics about the "extra" security protections in macOS
- How to get payload delivered with one click
- Code execution with arbitrary mount
- Gatekeepper evasion
- TCC protection evasion
- SIP -protection evasion
- Timeline
- How Apple will credit the researches</description>

                <description>Building Web-Applications is hard. Making them scale is even harder. And nobody said anything about robust yet.

Looking back over the past 25 years of Web-Development, not much has changed, except for tooling and languages. The approaches we use, also have not changed much. We still write lots of JavaScript, put special glue in between layers of languages, it's bleak.

Let's have a look at the Phoenix Framework, a modern approach to building Web-Applications in Elixir, on the Erlang VM, without having to resort to a multitude of languages and frameworks.

In this talk we will
- **NOT** pick a JavaScript framework like React or Angular
- **NOT** write a single line of JavaScript
- **NOT** care about Erlang or it's Syntax
- **NOT** spend hours to making the application WebSocket-capable and feel "live"

But we will
- write a state-of-the-art application that looks and feels professional in record time
- have tests for every feature, buttons, links or forms we implement (test-coverage upwards of 90%)
- have formatted our code, linted, error checked
- run the test-suite, before every commit</description>

                <abstract>Enterprise web applications have been deployed rapidly to the internet over the last ten years. Often, these applications remain secure, purely due to how difficult it is getting a copy of the source code. Unsurprisingly, some of the most popular enterprise web applications contain critical pre-authentication vulnerabilities. This presentation discusses how to get your hands on enterprise web applications and how to audit them for vulnerabilities, demonstrated through the disclosure of multiple 0days in popular enterprise web applications.</abstract>
                <description>When performing offensive source code analysis, the road to critical pre-authentication vulnerabilities usually involves a treacherous journey. From obtaining the source code, to mapping out sources and sinks, this presentation will take you on this journey to finding critical bugs in the following software:

- IBM Websphere Portal / HCL Digital Experiences
- Solarwinds Web Help Desk
- Sitecore Experience Platform
- VMWare Workspace One UEM (AirWatch)

By experiencing the discovery process of 0days in popular enterprise web applications, this process can be repeated on the enterprise applications your company uses. The vulnerabilities discussed in this presentation have all gone through a responsible disclosure process.</description>

                <abstract>Public viewing of the 4 part Videoland series "ze weten alles van je"
This movie is about the disappearance of Arjen Kamphuis. Arjen was part of orga of several early dutch hackercamps and regularly spoke at such events. It's safe to say he is "one of us"</abstract>
                <description>Almost four years ago, August 2018, the Dutch Cybersecurity expert Arjen Kamphuis disappeared while being on holiday in Norway. His disappearance is still veiled in mysteries. His kayak was found in a fjord near Bodø, but some days later his cellphone connected to a network deep in the south of Norway. Someone with his opsec and a his healthy distrust of governments and other authorities would have secured his mobile devices, so this ping must have been Kamphuis himself. Or so it was believed..

The Videoland series with the grim title "Ze Weten Alles van Je" chose to go with a interesting mix of fiction and non fiction; part documentary, part acting. Friends of Arjen get interviewed by an actress playing an investigative journalist who also travels to Norway in search for answers. During her search she interviews several people who were involved in the actual missing persons case. This story line is intertwined with some fiction and made up characters.

Videoland generously gave us permission to screen this series at MCH2022</description>

                <abstract>Digital maps are ubiquitous tools in our everyday life. In the early 90s, the idea of browsing the world digitally and visiting any place was groundbreaking. The first solution to this problem is known as "TerraVision", which was breathtaking at that time. Today, the idea of exploring your surroundings using digital maps has become pretty normal.

But how do these maps work? In this talk, I want to provide an overview of the foundations of digital mapping solutions. Differences between maps which use vector data and rasterized satellite imaginary will be outlined. Furthermore, a new and open-source map renderer called [maplibre-rs](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs) will be presented, which is created using Rust and modern web technologies like WebWorkers and WebAssembly. Lastly, I want to show differences between commercial solutions and free and open-source ones.

A lot of mobile and web applications depend on customizing and displaying maps. There are not many cross-platform solutions available. Some only work in the web. Some only work on mobile devices. 
Furthermore, there are only a few truly free and open-source mapping stacks available.
I want to explain how [maplibre-rs](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs) can solve current challenges by leveraging a modern rendering stack.</abstract>
                <description>Last year I had a lot of spare time and decided to kick-start a project which combines different areas of interest: Rust, 3D rendering, Geo data
This project was adopted recently by the [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/) project and is now known as [maplibre-rs](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs).

The [maplibre-rs](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs) library is a proof of concept which showed me the complexity of mapping solutions. It takes a lot of steps until edits from OpenStreetMap contributors are finally rendered in consumer applications. With this task I want to take listeners on a journey from drawing changes in the OpenStreetMap editor all the way until vectors are uploaded to from memory to GPUs.

Like outlined in the abstract, I want to cover multiple topics:

* Foundations of digital maps (How to determine which data should be loaded? What are vector and raster tiles?)
* Show the technology stack which allows us to design and develop a cross-platform map renderer (Web, Mobile, Desktop)

Lastly, I want to provide a software developer perspective on mapping technologies.</description>

                <abstract>Yes, this talk is about running your own mainframe on your own hardware. Mainframes are old, yes, but they are still very much alive. New hardware is still being developed and there are a lot of fresh jobs in this area too. A lot of mainframes run COBOL workloads. COBOL is far from a dead language. It processes an estimated 85% of all business transactions, and 5 billion lines of new COBOL code are written every year. In this session the speaker will help you in take your first steps towards running your own mainframe. If you like then after this session you can continue to build your knowledge of mainframe systems using the links provided during the talk. Come on in and learn the basics of a completely different computer system! And it will take you less than an hour to do that!</abstract>

                <abstract>Automotive hacking hasn't started with Miller/Valasek in 2015 - and it hasn't ended with it, either. This talk will give an overview of automotive insecurities of the past ~10 years, a brief history of some kind. I will also provide an outlook on what the future on four wheels might hold, security-wise.</abstract>
                <description>This talk will give an exhaustive overview of all the automotive hacks in the past 10 years, and analyze the technical issues and vulnerabilities that have been exploited. Ranging from the automotive hacking papers in the early 2010-ies by US researchers, towards the infamous Miller/Valasek presentations starting 2015, the magic work of KeenLabs and 360 Group, and covering comma.ai, the different Tesla hacks, entry system relay attacks and the recent ADAC study, towards AI-confusion attacks. I will try to analyze the underlying vulnerabilities, how they can be (respectively are already) prevented in modern vehicles, and what the future holds.</description>

                <abstract>A laser harp is a magic musical instrument that makes sounds from light beams.
Ever since Jean-Michel Jarre used a laser harp in his live concerts to play Rendez Vous 2, many people have dreamt to play one. But they are ridiculously expensive!
Klaas van Gend will discuss his ongoing journey with Pascal Ahout to design a cheap and simple laser harp suitable for a local percussionist group. A revolutionary simple laser harp, using only an Arduino board, and no moving parts.
Hopefully, at the time this talk happens, the design is ready to be demoed, so we’ll end with a live demo or a video recording showcasing our working laser harp.</abstract>
                <description>The director from St. Caecilia percussionists group Lieshout-Mariahout in Brabant always wants to go beyond just playing music. He loves to bring in nonstandard instruments, video or lighting tricks.
For an upcoming show, he wants to compose a new piece with a laser harp.
As usual, he came to his audio and lighting engineer Pascal Ahout, who asked software engineer Klaas van Gend to join in.
Together, they started designing a reliable laser harp from scratch, reviewing various sources on the internet and revisiting all design decisions. Their laser harp design looks remarkably different – no moving parts, no complex optics and cheap!
This talk will show the design process, implementation details and hopefully the results.
Indeed: the development is not done yet. So we may end the talk explaining why our ideas weren’t smart enough… We’ll have to see!
But we intend to end with a working demo.</description>

                <abstract>This talk will investigate how the concept of private property has fundamentally altered our behavior towards the environment. We will investigate how an alternative ontology of electronic waste is needed and argue why dumpster diving, hacking and reverse engineering abandoned electronics is more relevant than ever to tackle this problem.</abstract>
                <description>Within the discourse that surrounds the global rise in electronic waste, only a select range of subjects receive attention from the public - international relations, global waste management strategies and corporate greenwashing rhetoric that emphasizes a ‘circular’ economy. Although the legitimacy of these strategies can be debated, they fail to address the root of the problem. Following the pervasive concept of private property and how it has infiltrated the ways in which we think about ourselves, our relationships between each other and the environment, we will arrive at how this concept has solidified itself within the ontological frameworks we use to make sense of waste and electronic waste in particular. We will discuss how, when we get rid of the concept of private property (and subsequently the concept of waste), we can reimagine what abandoned electronics mean to us and how we can best address the incessant pressure from manufacturers to treat them as expendable, throw-away objects. We will discuss how collective dumpster diving, hacking and reverse engineering abandoned electronics might be a possible solution and present free and open source tools that could aid us in the process.</description>

                <abstract>Microbes are everywhere.  They are part of nature, both around us and inside of us.  When you provide their desired niche, you can make them do something for you, in a mutually beneficial arrangement.  This talk will take you into their realm, and show a few practical examples and hacking opportunities.</abstract>
                <description>Our climate is on fire, but we are still reaching for an Ultimate Solution.  We don't move until we get a drop-in replacement to sustain current habits, at no extra cost.  Our cognitive dissonance makes us trust politicians to deliver on promises, and energy vendors to withstand lucrative green washing.  But it is both interesting and profitable to be part of the solution, and not of the problem.

I have a long-standing fascination with microbial processes.  They are adaptive and resilient while they modestly take on chores that pull things back to nature's standards.  I think many problems that we are facing now can be solved locally and efficiently with clever combinations of technology and microbiology.  Not always complete solutions and not everything is simple, but they certainly add to resilience and taking ownership of problem *and* solution.

In a perfect situation, energy is harvested when&amp;where it is abundant and moved to when&amp;where it is needed.  This talk demonstrates ways of doing at least some of that with the help of microbial systems.  We will demonstrate overlap and connections, and conditions under which they may be hacked:

Outline:

  * Beer.  Vinegar.  Innoculation.  Permaculture.
  * Gut.  Fiber or Fat.  SCFA.  Immune system.  Epigenetics.
  * Biogas.  Acetate.  Sulphur and ammonia.  Garbage in, garbage out.
  * Microbial fuel cell.  Clay and carbon.  Training.
  * Pee.  Urea.  Energy calculations for a Raspberry Pee.
  * Poo.  Phosphate.  Energy calculations for iPoo mobility.
  * Compost.  Worms.  Energy calculations for heat generation.
  * Climate change &amp; zoonose.  Cramming sick animals.  Antibiotics.  Government ignorance.

Summary:

  * Making beer uses yeast to turn sugar to alcohol.  Yeast can flexibly adapt from/to glucose via DNA switching to generate different enzymes.  Let fruit flies in, and they bring along Acetobacter that reduce alcohol to vinegar.  Wild fermentation is more natural, and yields a lambic beer.  Save work by going for stable, naturally mixed processes.
  * Our gut processes whatever we can't.  Two rough kinds of colonies co-exist.  One consumes cholesterol/bile and the other plants/fiber.  They tune our body via SCFA, the immune system and epigenetics.  You can hack by changing your food (and after a few weeks, the microbes are thought to hack you by asking for more; so much for free will?!?)
  * Biogas works like a gut.  It forms/consumes acetate CH₃COOH to produce CO₂ and methane CH₄ with byproducts hydrogen H₂, hydrosulphide H₂S and ammonia NH₃.  Local cycles can process known sludge and produce usable liquid output, but large-scale anonymity destroys that.  Some influences are possible, but the process is basically difficult, smelly and a bit dangerous.
  * Microbes can live in a fuel cell, which then accepts electrons and passes H+ through a membrane.  Urine can be broken down with just clay and carbon -- and a culture.  What are researchers doing?  A variant to produce hydrogen H₂.  And the potential of driving microbes by passing in a current.
  * Pee contains urea (NH₂)CO(NH₂), a hydrogen carrier.  Urea is stable when dried, but otherwise reduces to ammonia NH₃.  Soil microbes normally turn ammonia into atmospheric N₂ and water.  But we can also use urea in a fuel cell to extract electricity or hydrogen.
  * Poo contains many microbes, some of which are pathogenic.  But it is also our disposal channel for phosphorous (which we mine to grow food) and nitrogen.  Troubled hygiene, but can this be safe?  Is it a good idea?
  * Compost is incredibly straightforward and safe.  The nutrient cycle is so short that nature could have invented it... oh wait, it did.  Spring brings a gradual start, Summer collects energy, Autumn sheds it off and Winter benefits from the captured energy.  Because composting generates heat, and has been used for heating homes, or parts of homes.  Though mostly self-controlled, there are broad requirements for heat retention, moisture, oxygenation and C:N ratio.  Working with these, you can have some degree of control over this process.
  * Microbes mutate if we force them into another environment.  Like a sick animal.  Or 3000 of them.  Antibiotics form a bonus challenge.  Many animal farmers carry resistent microbes.  Zoonoses are on the rise due to climate change, and they are the common source of infectious diseases.  Government practices [best effort management](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/wob-verzoeken/2020/10/28/besluit-wob-verzoek-prognoses-ziektekiemen-uit-dierhouderijen/Besluit+Wob-verzoek+prognoses+ziektekiemen+uit+dierhouderijen.pdf) by chasing for *known* diseases; they are generally clueless about possible future zoonoses and any involved risk to humans.

                <abstract>Data keeps flowing! In Android, we have the concept of permissions, users feel confident that only if they turn on the permission, their data is shared. But what about an app silently sitting on your device with no permission whatsoever! What can that app know about you?</abstract>
                <description>In this talk, I'll talk about the Privacy Posture of Android!
What kind of data is being collected, and how is it channelled and used? How does advertising work on mobile?
Can your device be fingerprinted? What kind of privacy threats exists on Android?
We will learn about the permission model of Android and how permissions operate at the kernel level!
This shall be followed by a demo of an Android app, which needs no permission from the user. We will see what all information can be retrieved from your device, without any permission!</description>

                <abstract>The Gigatron is a microcomputer without a microprocessor. It was made into a DIY electronics kit and sold over 1000 pieces from 2018 to 2020. It is now open source. In this talk, I will not go into the working of the kit, but explain what you need to think about when creating a kit and keeping it manageable. Think of what to design, sourcing components, testing, preventing too many support calls and more.</abstract>
                <description>The Gigatron is a microcomputer without a microprocessor. During the design phase, a decision was made to maybe make it into a Do-It-Yourself electronics kit. Many design decisions have been influenced by that decision, as creating a unique prototype is a lot different from creating a succesful kit.

In this talk, I will go over some of these design decisions. I think the majority of them worked out very well, as over 1000 kits were sold between 2018 and 2020, before the Gigatron becoming open source. These design decisions were influenced by other kit builders, who had already gone through that process, like the people behind the PiDP-8 and Enigma-E. 

I would like to share some of that knowledge, so you can also stand on the shoulders of the giants before me. And of course to also stimulate the attendees to make their hobby project into a kit.

No previous knowledge is needed. The talk is aimed at people wanting to turn their hobby project into a kit project.</description>

                <abstract>Systems created by humans may – no *will* – contain flaws. In order to shine a light on these flaws, you can use a technique called threat modelling. We will take a look at different threat modelling methods that empower hackers (and others) to study the architecture of a system.</abstract>
                <description>There are hundreds if not thousands of different threat modelling methods that can be used to tease apart the structure of a system in the search for security issues. In this workshop, we will cover the key principles behind these methods and we will provide prototypical worked examples. In order to give you hands-on experience with threat modelling, we will go through an archetypical threat modelling exercise together. We will close the workshop by having you apply these methods to one of your own systems. You will be provided with relevant background material to allow you to integrate threat modelling into your daily activities going forward.</description>

                <abstract>Want to get your hands dirty with Asterisk? Want to learn about how VoIP works? Then this is the workshop for you. In this workshop, you will learn how VoIP works and how you can quickly get started with the popular phone system Asterisk. Before you know it, you will be making and receiving calls and have a starting point for further tinkering.</abstract>
                <description>Asterisk is the 'swiss army knife' of Telephony. But getting started can be pretty daunting. So many config files, so much documentation, so little time...

In this workshop you will get a grasp on the basics of VoIP protocols and how you can configure Asterisk to quickly get up and running. Before you know it, you will be making and receiving calls with your own Asterisk phone system. After that, the possibilities are endless: start sending/receiving faxes, harass telemarketers or create hidden menus.

To participate in the workshop part, you will need some sort of VoIP phone. This can be hardware, but a VoIP phone on your PC will be more practical (a so-called 'softphone'). Recommendations for this are MicroSIP on Windows, Telephone on macOS or LinPhone on Linux distros.

You will be provided with a trunk account, phone number and Debian VPS with root access. Keep in mind that these will become inactive one day after the workshop. I will assume that you know how to navigate in a Linux shell and edit text files.</description>

                <description>The TLS protocol and your server configuration is pretty significant to user security. In this workshop we talk about the technical theory behind the scene. Also the CA and validation stages are discussed to understand what we're doing. So take your laptop and root passwords with you. Let's tune your server configuration with tools like testssl.sh, SSLLabs or internet.nl for a perfect score! Also common mistakes and how to analyse them will be handled in the workshop. This will help you in private and professional life too. NginX and Apache are most common, but I also like to pick up the challenge to learn more about other options. Control over your DNS will be assistive too.</description>

                <abstract>Yes, we have been using social media to connect for a long time now, but 2020 made us dependent on them more than ever. It's time we have an open dialogue. Burst our individual filter bubbles and communicate what our individual experience of social media feels like. In this session, we will come together, interact, go through a bunch of skillfully crafted activities and draw conclusions on what's the real state of our virtual lives? Which humane components are lacking? What extra aspects have been added? How is it affecting our bonding, privacy, individuality, organization, and dialogue?</abstract>
                <description>This session aims to identify and learn about several unrealistic aspects that have entered our lives knowingly/unknowingly through prominent social media. 
The session will be split into multiple modules and worksheets which will enable us to dive into discussions like what brings us to social media, what our interaction feels like, what economic principles govern the design of social media, what are the challenges and socio-cultural complexities that have been introduced in present day social media.
We will do a quick mix and match of popular opinions about social media amongst the group and perform thoughtful analysis of how we engage with these platforms by mapping the tech into real-life space-time. Thereby identifying the gaps and ineffectual features of social media focusing on how social media affects our bonding, individuality, organisation and dialogue.

Channeling in our creative spirits, we'd attempt to redesign the interface that can connect people across the globe in a more human manner.

Prerequisite: Attendees need to have at least one active social media account (LinkedIn/Twitter/Facebook/Instagram etc) and bring along their mobile phones with internet connectivity :)</description>

                <abstract>Many parsing tools and generators have been developed starting from a certain parsing algorithm. In the past twenty years, I have worked on a parser tool with a focus on usability and being intuitive. Not necessarily producing the most efficient parser, but one that is fast enough for practical purposes. The workshop will start with the most elementary aspects of parsing from examples and gradually explain all the complexities of writing grammars and explain the solutions to them.</abstract>
                <description>The workshop will start with some simple examples of parsing, starting with arithmetic expressions. An online interactive parser will be used to explain various examples and allow participants to experiment themselves.
Next the workshop will explain a practical and intuitive approach to specifying grammars. In a number of small steps, the various aspects will be explained. Subjects like operator priorities and dealing with ambiguity will be addressed. Also the build-in method for constructing an abstract syntax tree will be explained.
At the end the participants should be able to write a grammar for a small programming language and even implement an interpreter for it based on one that is provided.
If there is room to dive into the more technical aspects of the parser, I can delve into the various implementations in C, C++ and JavaScript.

I would very much like to give this as an interactive workshop, starting with the most simple question: What is 3 + 4? The materials for this workshop will can be found at https://fransfaase.github.io/MCH2022ParserWorkshop/</description>

                <abstract>Do we want social media platforms that provide neutral platform for pluralistic debate, or do we want social media platforms that protect their users from abuse and de-platform abusers? Can we have both? Is moderation censorship? Is Signal social media?</abstract>
                <description>The debate about how to deal with abusers and fascists on social media has been simmering for a long while, but really blew up after the siege of the US Capitol. It has become clear, finally, that [something needs to be done](https://redecentralize.org/blog/2021/01/18/centralization-is-a-danger-to-democracy.html). What remains unclear is... what?

This workshop will probably not offer answers, but will at least try to make sense of that debate. A debate which is tangled and twisted, and complicated by the fact that for some (like journalists) social media is the infrastructure they need to do their work and reach their audience, while for others (like activists) it's the service they use to communicate among themselves.

Combine this with how strong the incentives are for centralized social media monopolies to not "police content" (lest they be accused of censorship), and how their algorithms tend to promote most-clickable (and therefore often  extremist) content, and you find yourself in a discussion where journalists defend Nazis' access to Facebook.

There is plenty to unwrap there, so let's sit down and try to do just that together. Things that seem important (of course we will not limit our discussion to only these!) would be: 

## Is social media infrastructure, or service?

If it's infrastructure, we want it to be neutral (just like we want our ISPs not to police our bits on the wire). If it's a service, perhaps we want some moderation to happen?

Perhaps it needs to be both &amp;ndash; [a neutral infrastructure on which opinionated services can be built](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech)? This would immediately simplify this conversation, making it clear where moderation belongs, and where it doesn't.

## Giving platform vs. providing tools

There is a difference between giving platform and just providing communication tools. It is hard to argue Facebook not banning a prolific fascist does provide them with a platform. It is as hard to argue that Signal doing same does not.

This difference seems to disappear in a lot of discussions; for example, when some propose that mainstream social media should ban fascists, others claim that it doesn't matter since they will still be able to communicate on Gab or Parler.

However, neither Gab nor Parler has the reach of mainstream social media. Effectively, this leaves their users stewing in their own sauce, not able to radicalize anyone new. They can still communicate and organize, but adding new members comes with added friction. So, how important is that friction? How much difference does it make?

## Public vs. private channels of communication

A public Twitter profile with 50k followers is clearly a public channel. A Signal group of 10 people is clearly a private channel. Should a 50k-member Signal group considered private or public?

This question is relevant in the context of platform vs. tools distinction above. It's another way of asking: what is, really, the difference between a platform and an internal communication tool?

Signal has already added several "social" features (message reactions, and being able to join groups by clicking a link). Is keeping the groups invite-only on an encrypted platform enough for them to not be considered a "public" channel? If not, should Signal start moderating groups?..

What about closed Facebook groups &amp;ndash; can these be considered private channels? If so, can they be ignored by Facebook moderators?</description>

                <abstract>Hacking = playing. Let me take you along in this playshop to discover and experience the power of a playful mind and the science behind it.
In this Playshop we will Play ourselves a way through a lot of the scientific proof about the positive effects of embedding it in your day to day life. Playful people are more creative, have more fun and are overall more happy and joyful. Come to this session and unlearn this stupid idea that playing is for children!</abstract>
                <description>Playing is proven to be crucial for learning, innovating and mentoring. And thus a fundamental tool for any hacker or maker out there.
I rediscovered playing, made my job out of it and I would love to take you on a journey with an inspirational, interactive and pragmatic session to do so too (or even more)

There was a time in your life where you stopped playing. Or you probably didn’t. What’s up with the idea that playing is childish? Why do we ignore all the great scientific proof that playing is the best way to learn? This is a personal story about finding out what I need to do, combined with evidence based knowledge.

The take aways of this playshop are: 
– 7 most important scientific reasons why you should encourage playing in a professional setting. 
– The difference between playing and gaming. 
– 3 tips to start tomorrow. 
– A shitload of games which we will play and you can use yourself &#128578;
(I even have a CYBER! Game!) 

I rediscovered playing and I would love to take you on a journey with an inspirational and pragmatic session to do so too!

                <abstract>Scratch is a awesome language and tool to get started with programming in a playful and creative way. This workshop is intended for complete beginners as well as those who already have some experience with Scratch. 

---

Scratch is een geweldige taal en een programma om aan de slag te gaan met programmeren door een beetje creatief te klooien. Deze workshop is bedoeld voor zowel beginners als mensen die al wat ervaring met Scratch hebben.</abstract>
                <description>You'll learn the basics by creating an example game. After that, use your creativity and problem solving skills to make the game unique with your own rules and graphics. Ask around for help or to get advice on how to add a next challenge.

If you already have some experience with Scratch, you can also learn how to create beautifully colored fractal curves. In a few steps, you'll create Scratch code that will use itself (recursion) to draw a pattern that has the same properties, no matter how much you zoom in.

##### Practical information

- The workshop will be a mix of English and Dutch, and you can read a bit in both languages. Händen und Füßen will be used if necessary.
- You need to bring your own computer or tablet that connects to the internet. Don't forget to charge the battery and bring someone to help you with carrying and using it if necessary.
- You can use Scratch with almost any computer or tablet that runs an internet browser. Try: https://scratch.mit.edu/create. Bigger, brighter, upright screens work best.
- Scratch was designed for ages 8 and up. It could be good to bring someone to help you out. Solving programming challenges together can be a lot of fun.

### Nederlands

Leer de basis door een voorbeeldspelletje te maken. Gebruik daarna je creativiteit en vindingrijkheid om je spel uniek te maken met eigen regels, afbeeldingen en animaties. Vraag rond voor hulp of om advies te krijgen om een volgende uitdaging aan je spel toe te voegen.

Als je al wat ervaring met Scratch hebt kan je ook leren hoe je prachtig gekleurde fractals kan maken. In een paar stappen maak je Scratch-code die zichzelf gebruikt (recursie) om een patroon te tekenen die steeds dezelfde eigenschappen heeft, hoe ver je ook inzoomt.

##### Praktische informatie

- De workshop zal een mix van Engels en Nederlands zijn, en je kan iets lezen in beide talen.
- Neem je eigen computer of tablet met internetverbinding mee. Vergeet 'm niet op te laden, en neem iemand mee die je helpt met dragen en gebruiken als dat nodig is.
- Scratch werkt op bijna elke computer of tablet met een internetbrowser. Probeer: https://scratch.mit.edu/create. Grotere, heldere schermen die rechtop staan werken het beste.
- Scratch is ontworpen voor 8 jaar en ouder. Het kan helpen om iemand mee te nemen om je te assisteren. Samen programmeeruitdagingen oplossen kan erg leuk zijn.</description>

                <abstract>[TLA+, the temporal logic of actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA+), is a high-level specification language to design, document, and verify reactive systems. It has been around for two decades and is used in [academia](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00768812) and by [hardware-](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/intel-excerpt.html?back-link=industrial-use.html?unhideBut@EQhide-intel@AMPunhideDiv@EQintel), and [software-people](https://probablydance.com/2020/10/31/using-tla-in-the-real-world-to-understand-a-glibc-bug/) [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zSynTfLDE) [various](https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/conf/2018/sf/reliable-by-design-applying-formal-methods-to-distributed-systems) companies.  Its application spans the design of [complex cloud systems](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/4/184701-how-amazon-web-services-uses-formal-methods/fulltext), [concurrent and distributed](https://github.com/tlaplus/Examples/tree/master/specifications/PaxosHowToWinATuringAward) algorithms, processor hardware vulnerabilities [(spectre/meltdown)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le1R9P5H9C4), ...
TLA+ has been described as a lightweight formal method, debuggable design, and the missing link between code and design documents.</abstract>
                <description>This workshop shows how to design a distributed system in TLA+, focusing on applying TLA+ rather than the language's theory. More specifically, we cover parts of my [tutorial](https://github.com/tlaplus-workshops/ewd998) on modeling a [termination detection algorithm](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd09xx/EWD998.PDF). This is a hands-on, interactive workshop. Come and find out what modeling and TLA+ are good for.</description>

                <abstract>Using a DIY conductive dough/clay you will create your own creatures and adorn them with working (basic) electronics like LED's and buzzers. Always wanted to create a snail with blinking lights? Or a lovely heart with lights? This is your chance! This workshop is aimed at kids (4 - 10yrs)  Supervision of an adult is required. The dough uses food coloring and is made using basic food ingredients. Food allergies? Check the recipe in our repository before taking part!</abstract>
                <description>Using nothing but basic kitchen ingredients (flour, salt, lemon juice, vegetable oil)  we will create a conductive dough (clay) in different colors (using food coloring). Combined with a battery pack (6Volts) the dough is conductive enough due to the salt and lemon juice (and therefor also not edible) to power LED's and a simple buzzer. 

You will be able to sculpt  your own creations. Add basic electronics like LED's and buzzers and make them come alive! This workshop is aimed at kids (4 - 10yrs)  Supervision of an adult is required. Food allergies? Check the recipe in our repository before taking part!</description>

                <abstract>Participants will learn the complete workflow of creating a circuit board with KiCad. At the end of the workshop, you will have a designed PCB that blinks some LEDs and is ready for manufacturing. No prior experience is required, basic electronics knowledge is useful.</abstract>
                <description>**Important**: You need to bring a Notebook with KiCad 6.x including the symbol- and footprint libraries installed. It does not matter which OS. If possible, bring a mouse with a scroll-wheel.

The workshop will have a 10-15minutes lecture part in the beginning where the whole process is demonstrated. You won't need to take notes, a cheat-sheet with the process-steps and the most important shortcuts will be provided.
After the introduction you will draw a simple circuit that blinks two LEDs. Create the layout for it and export manufacturing data. Experienced KiCad users will be around the whole time to answer questions and 

People who know KiCad already are welcome as well. For discussion as well as additional help. 

You can get KiCad at https://www.kicad.org/ (**don't'** use kicad-pcb.org). Most linux distributions will also have a packaged version, make sure to also install the symbol and footprint libraries.</description>

                <abstract>In this workshop, we will learn how to assemble tiny parts on circuit boards by building an electronic touch-activated purring kitten. Anyone can do it. Yes, even you who never touched anything electronic before. Takes 120mins, 20€/kit, avoid caffeine immediately before. Max 10 participants per session, sign up on PAPER at the Hardware Hacking Area.</abstract>
                <description>Takes about two hours. Basic workshop. No prior knowledge needed. Materials cost 20€ per kit.

We are going to build an electronic kitten using tiny tiny SMD parts. It will purr when you touch it right and hiss when you touch it wrong. It's going to work. You will learn how to make your hands not shake at all ever. You will learn how to activate your builtin precision positioning superpowers.

For people afraid of surface mount assembly/rework. You know those tiny little components in modern electronic devices? It's both possible and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you how!

Think you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s? Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is minimal and you probably already have it. We'll learn the answer to THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no longer need to be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before the workshop, because shaky hands are a disadvantage.

The workshop kit costs 20€. Please SIGN UP ON THE PAPER LIST at the Hardware Hacking Area. PLEASE BE ON TIME!</description>

                <abstract>We are not machines. We need to look after ourselves and each other in order to better look after each other and achieve what we want to achieve. Also, keeping the population subdued through stress, loneliness, sickness and anxiety is a feature of late-stage capitalism.</abstract>
                <description>Regenerative culture is about relationships. Our relationships with ourselves and personal histories, our relationships with what we struggle against, our relationships with other individuals day to day, and our relationships as a group – these are completely interdependent. Self care is also about taking care of the animal parts of the self that respond instinctively to stressful situations with fight or flight or faint.  
A regenerative human culture is healthy, resilient and adaptable; it cares for the planet and it cares for life in the awareness that this is the most effective way to create a thriving future for all of humanity. Regenerative culture means improvements year on year, taking small steps to heal and improve, and on all levels, including individuals and communities. More than being a network of “activists”, we seek to find ways of being and doing that support positive change.</description>

                <abstract>My son Jurre and I got involved in helping less Tech-Savvy people find answers and recover precious data after someone close to them took their own life. This lecture describes our challenging and emotional journey as we hope to inspire others to follow our path.

                <description>After several talks about Hardware Hacking this talk will be one on a more serious matter. After someone takes their life and the police closes their case, the next of kin may still have questions that are left  unanswered. This talk is about our journey from being nerds helping out with computer problems to specialists trying to help the next of kin find answers to questions they might still have. 

And as this talk will be hosted for computer specialist who spend quite some effort making sure they are protected from external threat ask yourself this question; Will your loved ones be able to control the infrastructure or even have access to the family photo's when you pass away?</description>

                <abstract>The talk is on Introduction to opens source investigations. Aiganysh will explain what "open source" is, what kind of research you can do with it, and the challenges it entails from Bellingcat's experience. The presentation will be full of case studies and exercises such as geolocating ISIS supporters from Twitter and identifying neo-nazi criminals in the US.</abstract>
                <description>Bellingcat has conducted open source investigations into the downing of MH17, syrian chemical attacks, high level poisonings, corruption investigations, ecological research, war monitoring and etc. So what is open source investigations, how can you do it and what challenges come with it? 
To learn more about that join the talk by Aiganysh Aidarbekova, Bellingcat's researcher and trainer. The talk will also have case studies and exercises such as geolocating ISIS supporters from Twitter and identifying neo-nazi criminals in the US.</description>

                <abstract>As of today, most discussions on cyber security focus on privacy and the implications of incidents involving data. However, those of us in cyber physical security often see things differently as we study actors attempting to use computers to impact the physical world (e.g. critical infrastructure and industrial controls). Geopolitical conflicts and accessible offensive security tools make defending against these threats increasingly complex. The anthology I bring for you illustrates the evolution of cyber physical threats through several stories with topics that span from non-fiction espionage and crime thrillers to politically-motivated intrusions and master tinkerers’ ill-fated creations. By focusing on the different players involved and their motivations, I intend not to hype up the scenario, but instead to accurately describe what we observe daily in the cyber physical threat intelligence community.</abstract>
                <description>“First Privacy, Now Safety: An Anthology of Tales from the Front Lines of Cyber Physical Security” will consist of a series of real stories to illustrate the evolution of cyber physical threats related to topics that span from non-fiction espionage and crime thrillers to politically-motivated intrusions and master tinkerers’ ill-fated creations. The selection of topics results from my personal experience as a member of the cyber threat intelligence community in Washington, D.C. with a very pacifist perspective of life. Some example stories include:

•	The Unwilling Pawn – How our infrastructure gets swept up in geopolitical conflicts
•	Everybody Be Cool, This is a Robbery! – How criminals can make more money by getting physical.
•	What if I Click Here? – Errant tales from hackers learning about cyber physical systems. (And sometimes erring in the process). 

All of the stories I will talk about can be verified by the audience in open sources and specialized publications, although they may not appear in any popular books or videos until a couple years from now.</description>

                <abstract>When the pandemic was declared over, Europe went into a war. This was the first major conflict in Europe where an important part of the war was waged online.
Anonymous, disBalancer, IT ARMY, and the western governments.

These are stories from the cyber front lines.</abstract>
                <description>[Things will surely change over March, so this is preliminary]

This is intended as a panel of speakers from Ukraine and the rest of Europe. We will discuss what happened on the front, how it helped to win &#129310; the war, the international cooperation, the cyber offensive, and the how and why of it.

We will discuss, DDoS, information disclosures, backdooring, psyops, and propaganda.

[TBC when the fog dissipates, I will invite the most relevant people] I will ask Mykhailo Fedorov, Anastasiia Voitova, Chris Kubecka and [TBD] to join me in person or remotely to share their stories.</description>

                <description>Your organisation suffers from a serious system compromise from a cyber-crime ring, state-actor or both. The cyber inferno is raging through your organisation. The problems are countless. A neighbouring organisation is looking at your problems and wondering about the potential of spillovers. What if these spillovers escalate beyond your grasp? How and what do you communicate internally and externally? In this talk I’d like to walk you through a situation which escalated quickly. The talk is intended to inspire people to take preventative measures, keep their heads as cool as possible, and keep a grip on the situation regardless of the size of the challenge.</description>

                <abstract>Pentesting can provide vital information to organisations about their security. However, many reports end up never being used or not being used to their full potential. That is partly due to the pentesters and their writing skills. But in large part is also to be attributed to CISO's lack of guidance and involvement. 

I am not a spokesperson for all CISOs, but I do have quite a bit of experience in the pentesting field as a CISO. As such; I would like to share my thoughts about how a CISO can lead the pentesting process as effectively as possible, as well as what I as a CISO like to see in my pentesting reports.

I will also highlight why some reports don't get used and why I think we struggle with this as much as we sometimes do.

I think this information is usefull for pentesters and CISO's alike, because it shows both sides how the other one works and thinks.</abstract>
                <description>Many pentesting reports are never followed up on, which is a shame, because a lot of hard work goes into them a lot of the time.

In this talk I will try to explain why this happens and will try to clarify how we can make some changes to the practice, reporting and follow up to make pentests more effective.</description>

                <abstract>During crises – like COVID19 – software is made under immense pressure in a volatile environment. Security should focus on anything that makes one vulnerable. OpenKAT does this with real forensic proof, with the right context and useful in real life.</abstract>
                <description>The COVID19-crisis forced to build dozens of software solutions rapidly with too few people under immense pressure. Meanwhile the threat level as well as the stakes are high. Failure is not an option yet guaranteed. You can no longer afford vague questions like are we secure? You need to find what makes you vulnerabilities before that hit you as well as soon as they hit you.

With dozens COVID-testing organizations to monitor, three countries to help, 17 projects to help come to life and to guard during operation security is an impossible job with the tools and people available. The options are simple: drown or find a trick to survive.The COVID19-crisis forced to build dozens of software solutions rapidly with too few people under immense pressure.

The OpenKAT-project was started to fill in that gap to take a radical different approach on security while not discarding what we have already. KAT (cat in Dutch) delivers information on vulnerabilities in a forensic accurate manners, monitors environments and more over proves how things change over time.

                <abstract>This talk gives an introduction in how single sign-on protocols (such as SAML, OAuth 2, and Open ID Connect) work. Subsequently, I will talk about the most commonly found vulnerabilities in these protocols. Finally, I will show various ways to resolve these vulnerabilities.</abstract>
                <description>Single sign-on remains a hot topic in 2022. Many organisations are in the process of moving identity management and authentication out of of their application, and offload it to an identity provider. By doing so, application owners hope to avoid the challenges that come with identity management. However, the application will still needs to obtain the user’s identity from the identity provider, which is done using a single sign-on protocol.
 
Unfortunately (or fortunately?), single sign-on protocols are difficult to get right. Flaws in the implementation of single sign-on protocols can have serious consequences. In the worst case, such flaws allow hackers to log into the application as an arbitrary user. And this is not just a theoretical risk, but something I encounter in my work as ethical hacker on a regular basis.
 
I will start this talk by giving an introduction to some of the protocols that are commonly used to achieve single-sign on. Such protocols include SAML, OAuth 2, and Open ID Connect. Subsequently, I will talk about the state of single-sign on applications as I encounter them as an ethical hacker. I will demonstrate which vulnerabilities I encounter in the real world, and what the consequences of such vulnerabilities could be.
 
At the end of this talk, you should have a good overview of how single sign-on protocols work, what types of vulnerabilities typically occur in them, and how to protect against such vulnerabilities.</description>

                <description>Most of us are very familiar with multiple ways of manipulating or creating audio content; filters, effects, synthesizers, etc., and most certainly don’t think about where the audio content is going to be reproduced. What if I told you your creativity could go further, and you can also control how sound is being reproduced?
In this talk, we will learn about sound field generation and control systems, their benefits, and everything you need to build your own Wave Field Synthesis and Beamforming system. Additionally, we will unveil some of the implementation and infrastructure challenges we faced and solved at HOLOPLOT and then let you hear what a HOLOPLOT Matrix Array can actually do.</description>

                <abstract>What is inside a Verifone VX820 payment terminal and how can we run our own code (i.e. Doom) on it?

This is a story of a software guy messing around with an interesting embedded device. It includes some reverse engineering, *interesting* security practices, proprietary executable formats, and a game of bootloader hopscotch.</abstract>
                <description>Starting with an overview of the Verifone VX820 payment terminal's hardware and software, we will follow my curious exploration with the final goal of arbitrary code execution. We will see how such seemingly single-purpose devices actually allow for general purpose computing under the hood, and even contain all the peripherals needed for a fun (retro-)gaming experience. 

I will show the struggles and practicalities of turning a (previously found and published) bootloader vulnerability into a practical exploit. This includes some reverse-engineering of bootloaders, kernel code, communication protocols and file headers.

Following this I will cover the "engineering" part: how to construct a minimum viable "toolchain" to be able to port a codebase like Doom.

There will be demos of the exploit and some programs that have been ported :)</description>

                <description>The pandemic has brought live streaming video to the masses. Panoramic 360° video offers more immersion, but has unique challenges. There are plug and play solutions, however they use centralized services such as Facebook and YouTube that invade our privacy and spam us with ads.
In this talk (live streamed in 360° video) i will explain how to setup your own 360° live stream using your own free software streaming servers and viewing the 360° stream on desktops, mobile devices and VR headsets in the browser. If you want to setup your own stream you'll need a camera (i tested with Insta360 One R and HumanEyes Vuze).

The talk will cover all parts:
1. Camera setup
2. Setting up the RTMP streaming server
3. Adding HTML5 Live Streaming (HLS)
4. Setting up browser based clients for desktop, mobile and VR</description>

                <abstract>If the perfect Blue Team exists, does that mean the Red Team doesn’t stand a chance against it or is there still a way to sneak their phish in the mailbox of their target? Well in this talk we investigate how a Red Team could sneak past even the best Blue Team imaginable. 
We analyse how a perfect Blue Team would detect malicious domains targeting their organization, how they would correlate these to other threat infrastructure to burn the whole campaign and how they would block a successful initial foothold in case they did not detect the phish campaign before its launch. 
By assuming the perfect adversary, we discuss techniques and important OPSEC measures Red Teams need to use to get a successful and undetected initial foothold in their targeted organization. 
Through practical demos and real-life examples, attendees will learn invaluable techniques and OPSEC measures to improve their Blue or Red Team tradecraft.</abstract>
                <description>If the perfect Blue Team exists, does that mean the Red Team doesn’t stand a chance against it or is there still a way to sneak their phish in the mailbox of their target? Well in this talk we will investigate how a Red Team could sneak past the best Blue Team imaginable. By analyzing techniques the perfect Blue Team would use, we define OPSEC measures and techniques to remain undetected and accomplish a successful initial foothold.

How would a perfect Blue Team detect malicious domains targeting their organization? 
o	BLUE: By dissecting patterns of adversaries and resulting OPSEC mistakes, we specify how domain and Certificate Transparency Log monitoring can unveil domains impersonating your organization. 
o	RED: We explain measures the Red Team can take to avoid being caught through domain and CTL monitoring by using wildcard SSL certificates and avoiding typosquatting.

How would a perfect Blue Team correlate detected malicious domains to related threat infrastructure? 
o	BLUE: Once a suspicious domain is identified, we can correlate this to other threat infrastructure using NetLoc intelligence techniques. Through correlation, Blue Teams can leverage OPSEC mistakes to uncover and potentially burn the whole campaign. 
o	RED: We explain measures the Red Team can take to avoid the correlation between their threat infrastructure and avoid the detection of one domain leading to the whole threat infra being burned. 

How would the perfect Blue Team attempt to block undetected phishing campaigns during their launch. 
o	BLUE: We analyze how the use of reputational scoring based on IP, Domain and Mail server, can block many phishing campaigns during the launch itself.
o	RED: We explain how Red Teams can age and categorize their domains to pass IP/Domain/Mail based reputation detections. 

What if a phishing mail sneaks by the Blue Team and lands in the inbox of one of their employees, has Red Team won? Not yet:
o	BLUE: The perfect Blue Team has hardened employee endpoints to make a successful exploitation after a click almost impossible. We discuss several defensive techniques on how to block successful initial foothold through Macro execution hardening, Applocker, Exploit Guard and endpoint security solutions. 
o	RED: Assuming a fully hardened system, we discuss strategies that could bypass all off these hardening measures and have been proven to be successful in past engagements

We conclude with a summary of techniques both Blue and Red Teamers can use to perfect their tradecraft.</description>

                <abstract>There’s no quick fix for the misinformation, disinformation, and lies were seeing in the world these days, and its natural for hackers want to work on the problems with the skills at hand. I’m going to talk about why, for hackers, that’s not necessarily a good move to do solo. I’ll go over mistakes I’ve seen way too many technologists and academics make when approaching the subject, where misinformation *really* comes from, and where the audience can harness what they’re good at.</abstract>
                <description>It is deceptively easy to see misinformation as a data problem, as a societal issue of algorithms run amok on soulless social media platforms. However, just because the delivery of misinformation is purely technical, it doesn’t mean that the cause, or solution, is also technical. In the more than half a decade I have been working on factchecking misinformation and disinformation I have see this point lost over and over to technologist, hackers, hobbyists and academics.

This is a huge waste of talented resources, and in this talk I will go over why this is the case and explain the most serious problems that journalists, fact-checkers and politicians are facing. Hackers have been addressing large-scale issues for decades, and my talk will lay a framework down for how the MCH community and beyond can work on the lies that are propagated across the internet and the world.

There’s never been more of a need for help, and I will explain how to get the most bang for your buck.</description>

                <abstract>PolyCoin - A distributed game across MCH. The history at EMF Camp 2018 and 2022, and how it was made and works.  See what is on the inside of the PolyCoin crypto miner devices, and why they were designed the way they were and what had to be compromised along the way, what can be improved, and plans for future versions.</abstract>
                <description>PolyCoin - is a game being deployed at MCH 2022, you'll see the PolyCoin crypto miner units installed throughout the site.  This game involves "capturing" the crypto miners using an RFID card to collect the fictional crypto currency PolyCoin.  Each player selects one of four fictional global corporations to support, and captures the crypto miners for their chosen company producing PolyCoins for them.  The company with the most PolyCoins wins!

Delving in to the brief history of the game at EMF Camp 2018 and 2022, and then explaining how it works and the various bits hang together to create the overall game.  Covering PICmicro, ESP8285 (micropython), DFR0299, RC522 RFID, MQTT, Python on Raspberry Pi, and the hidden features of the game waiting to be discovered.

I'll cover the problems with the original game deployed in EMF 2018 and how they were addressed with the PolyCoin game in 2022.  Then the problems encountered in 2022 at EMF camp (far less issues!).

This would ideally be suited to having this presentation followed by a hands-on session to see the parts that make the game.  I should have enough bits to run a workshop as well to build a PolyCoin crypto miner unit, including surface mount and hand soldering all the parts and assembling the units themselves.</description>

In this talk, dwangoAC will show how TASBot, with help from a human speedrunner, can use a Stale Reference Manipulation exploit in the N64 game Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time to achieve persistent Arbitrary Code Execution to obtain the Triforce and many other surprising outcomes that have to be seen to be believed.</abstract>
                <description>The TASBot community, led by dwangoAC, has exploited glitches in a variety of creative ways leading to Twitch chat streamed through a Super Game Boy, Super Mario Bros. being played inside Super Mario World, and many more. Most of these exploits were on older NES and SNES consoles, but what could be done if Arbitrary Code Execution could be achieved on an N64? This talk aims to show the beautiful results that can ensue after taking complete control of Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, including obtaining the Triforce itself! The talk will cover controller protocol evil maid attacks, Stale Reference Manipulation (Use After Free) exploitation, a four stage bootstrap chain to attain high speed data transfer, and more with audiovisual elements that are sure to be a surprise.</description>

                <description>The security of Tesla's cars has been a hot topic in recent months. In addition to being one of the safest cars on the road, it is also well-protected from hacks and attacks. But how does Tesla make sure their vehicles are safe and secure?

Tesla is a company that has been innovating in the automobile industry for many years. They have been designing and manufacturing electric vehicles which are environmentally friendly and sustainable. Tesla has also been pioneering and implementing new technologies in the automotive industry. One of these innovations is their Bluetooth interface which is used for locking and unlocking vehicles and can be used to uniquely identify cars, as well as to track them in real-time with apps like "Tesla Radar".

The introduction of Tesla's Bluetooth passive entry system, previously only used by model 3 and model y, into new product lines like the Tesla 2021 Model S/X facelift variant, shows the strategic importance of this technology for Tesla in the years to come.

This case study sheds light on the inner workings of Tesla's Passive Entry System and core VCSEC protocol, and reveals possible attack vectors.</description>

                <abstract>In his 1948 [scientific article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) entitled ["A mathematical theory of communication"](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf), Claude E. Shannon introduced the word “bit”. The article laid down the foundations for the field of information theory which in turn opened up the way to digital information processing.

In this overview talk, I will present in an accessible way three nuggets from Shannon information theory:
1. Shannon entropy, a mathematical quantification of uncertainty of a probability distribution.
2. Information Compression: Shannon entropy provides a fundamental lower bound on how much information from a source can be compressed so that it can later be recovered.
3. Error correction: when digital information is transmitted over a noisy channel, the methods of error-correction provide ways to protect this information from noise. Yet again, Shannon entropy provides the fundamental quantity of how much information can be transmitted over a noisy channel.

While the content of this talk is of mathematical nature, I will try my best to make it accessible to anybody with (very) basic knowledge of probabilities and programming.</abstract>
                <description>Since 2014, I have been teaching a yearly master course about information theory at the University of Amsterdam. Together with my PhD student Yfke Dulek, we have written [lecture notes](https://github.com/cschaffner/InformationTheory/blob/master/Script/InfTheory3.pdf) on the topic  and developed some additional learning tools based on these notes.

I love the mathematical beauty of Shannon’s information theory, and I believe that the three concepts above can be appreciated by a much wider audience that does not regularly read  scientific papers of the mathematical kind. While I will focus on making the fundamental theoretical aspects accessible to the audience, all of these concepts also have some interesting (and challenging) programming aspects to them that can be explored further after my talk.</description>

                <abstract>"SomeApp would like to access files in your Documents folder." Anyone who has used macOS recently will be familiar with these prompts. But how do they work? What happens if you deny the access? Are they an effective defense against malware?

This talk will give an up to date overview of the local security measures of macOS and describe some ways they can be defeated in practice.</abstract>
                <description>Sandboxing on macOS was introduced 13 years ago, but Apple didn't leave it at that. Starting with the release of macOS Catalina in 2019, even non-sandboxed apps need to deal with sandbox-like restrictions for files: all apps now need to ask permission to access sensitive files, like those in the user's documents or desktop folder. Features such as the camera and geolocation already needed user approval from a permission prompt. This system of user controlled permissions is known as Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC).

Any new security measure like this will also mean the introduction of new security boundaries, with new classes of vulnerabilities. Many parts of the system have to be re-examined to check for these vulnerabilities. For example, apps can now try to attack other apps in order to "steal" the permissions granted by the user to those apps. Apple has taken steps to allow apps to defend themselves against this, such as the hardened runtime. Ultimately, however, it is up to the developer of an app to safeguard its permissions. Many developers are not aware of this new responsibility or do not take it seriously. Developers who are used to the security model of Windows or Linux often do not know that these boundaries even exist. To make matters worse, Apple's documentation and APIs for these features are not as clear and easy to use as they should be.

This talk will start with an overview of local security restrictions on the latest version of macOS, Mojave. Then, it will cover some ways these protections might be bypassed in third-party applications. Finally, we will show some vulnerabilities we found in software that allowed escaping the macOS sandbox, stealing TCC permissions and privilege escalation, such as CVE-2021-30688, CVE-2020-10009 and CVE-2020-24428.</description>

                <abstract>In recent times, internet censorship has increased throughout the world. With governments realising the potential of the internet in spreading information as well as misinformation. 
To curb or rather control this, governments around the globe have taken to censoring parts of the internet by directing major ISPs to block access to those websites.
The ISPs around the globe have used different methods to block the access. Some resulting in DNS filtering to others doing SNI ( Server Name Information ) inspection.
There have been ways to bypass these restrictions, like DoH ( DNS over HTTPS ) and eSNI ( encrypted SNI ), now ECH ( Encrypted Client Hello ), supported by TLS 1.3.
To counter these, some authoritarian regimes ( like China ) have blocked eSNI traffic altogether, to be able to sniff the traffic and block the websites accordingly on their ‘Great Firewall’.
I will be talking about how these different mechanisms of blocking user traffic works, by doing a live demo of packet analysis using wireshark.
Later on in the talk, I will show a comparative study of the different ISPs around the globe and what their approaches are at blocking the internet ( if any ).
After understanding how the technologies work, I will show ways to bypass the censorship by some open source tools, DIY solutions and finally some paid/managed alternatives. What are the things that one should look for when choosing one such paid solution.
Towards the end, I will announce the open source repo for the tool used to conduct this project, where people can contribute and use it for their own research purposes.</abstract>
                <description>I am analysing some of the major ISPs 'around the globe' and how they’re blocking websites and easy + cost-effective ways to bypass them. There has been some previous research into this, but that has included some limited dataset, back in 2020. From then to now a few things have changed including the way ISPs are blocking websites.
With this project, I am trying to :

1. Analyse the global censorship of internet
    1. Globally, how different ISPs block the network traffic
    2. Distribute the client globally and ask volunteers to run this at least once
2. Release the client and server code as open source
3. Publish all the data, country wise on a github repo for everyone to consume

The talk would be in two parts :
- First : Where I talk about the technical nitty-gritties as to how censoring in modern times work.
- Second : After understanding how the technologies work, we will try to bypass those by some open source tools, some DIY solutions and finally some paid/managed alternatives, what are the things to look for when choosing one such provider.

Hence, even for folks who aren't much into the technical details of censorship, would have some arsenal of tools to bypass it, by the end of the talk. 
Starting with the famous question : 
“What happens when you type a (https) URL in your browser and press enter ?”
I will cover all the aspects, starting with 
1. DNS lookup
2. TLS Handshake - ClientHello,TLS negotiation, ServerHello etc
3. Encrypted Data Transfer

All of these would be shown a live demo of in wireshark, alongwith decrypting the traffic using certificates.

Explaining these stages are important because each of these involve ISPs tampering with to censor the internet. Once we know how it’s done, we will figure out how to resolve this privacy issue. Like :
Stage 
How ISPs censorConfirmation TestBypass
DNS Lookup
Their own DNS as default
DNS filtering
Check on dnsleaktest.com
Use DoH ( DNS over HTTPS )
dnscrypt

TLS Handshake
SNI Inspection
Use the tool
Check on wireshark
Use VPN
eCH

Further move on to ECH ( Encrypted Client Hello ) and why China hates it .
Show a comparative analysis of the different ISPs I’ve tested using the tool.

Towards the end talk about the open source tool, the client and server code themselves.
The tool, client app : 
1. Sends request to alexa top 1M domains
2. Records packet response and to find what kind of filtering is in place ( if any )
3. Sends data to central dashboard server for generating heatmaps and graphs
The tool, server app : 

1. Will consume all the JSON data and validate its findings.
2. Generate heat maps for all the ISPs and different websites that are blocked.

Talk about solutions to bypassing the censorship :
1. Open source tools &amp; solutions - DoH, changing default DNS etc
2. DIY things - self hosted 1-click VPN, ephemeral on-demand sshtunnel etc
3. Paid solutions - Things to look for when choosing one such paid solution</description>

                <abstract>After finding a 0-day in Canon hardware, we went on a hacking trip around the world.

We exploited the hardware in 20 Universities worldwide
We contacted Canon.
Talks broke down.
Our site got taken down.
We learned lessons we didn't expect.

We would like to describe the pleasure we had, the problems we faced, the moral dilemma's, and the solutions we found.

Also we will include lots of screenshots and perhaps a live demo ?</abstract>
                <description>It was a covid-lockdown period, oversight on homework and education of my son was my responsibility now, so i started with the basics:

...we are not the Protocol Police" ;)

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8962#section-3.1  "


We took a hacking "fieldtrip" around the world to all major Universities and some gov facilities.

To our surprise we got in, 
...and we got root.         ... *Evil Grin* 

Here's what we learned.


We exploited the hardware in 20 Universities, and published CVE-2021-38154 on https:/protocolpolice.org  [offline now]

See https://web.archive.org/web/20210829053914/https://protocolpolice.nl/CVE-2021-38154_Protocol_Police_Catwalk_Alert    ( since takedown by Dutch gov. )

Our site got taken down by Dutch government, for some other fun we'll get to. We have learned lessons we didn't expect.

We would like to describe the problems we faced, the moral dilemma's, and the solutions we found.

The gaping hole that Dutch Justice will have to gap, to get to a point where they can start to understand what an RFC means, and how it will overrule Dutch Law any day, ... all year long ;)
( Been there, done that, .... made prosecution eat their paperwork. )

The Dutch gov has got a long road ahead on understanding the internet, where it will have to succeed in 1 of 2 options fast,
 ...because the Justice Departement is losing the battle:

1.  - Make the whole world respect and acknowledge Dutch Law as a worldwide standard.
2.  - Adapt it's attitude and start RTFM.

...That's an easy 50% chance, ..right?
...place your bets ;)


Also we will include lots of screenshots and perhaps a live demo ?

1 Discovery of the Exploit: we were fooling around on Shodan and noticed how the server had multiple ports to the same portal.
2 We tried some big Universities and to our surprise we could get in and edit anything.
3 We did some quick research on how to write an advisory, and where to publish it.
4 We contacted Canon and hoped to work with them, ... not happening.
5 We reserved a CVE , and started latteral movement.
6 We tried to warn sys-admins in Universities worldwide.
7 Moving latteral... "remote cascading"
9 We exploited the * out of a lot of stuff, not fully realising the potential harm.
10 We looked at informing NCSC, here's why we could not talk to them:
11 We started emailing Certs of other countries, ... they DID respond and were glad with the heads-up before going live with the exploit
12 Nucleair data,... where to drop that ?
13 The takedown, ...Don't Talk To The Police!!!
14 Lessons learned.  ( we never even got the f*ckin t-shirt )
15 Questions?</description>

                <abstract>Overview of **SmartOS** - an illumos based distribution with **focus of virtualization**. Must be named technologies used by SmartOS: ZFS, Crossbow, Zones, DTrace, Bhyve. The talk will show you the benefits of SmartOS; Configuration and management of SmartOS virtualization technologies; Tooling on top of SmartOS.</abstract>
                <description>SmartOS is a specialized Type 1 Hypervisor platform based on illumos.  It supports two types of virtualization:

- OS Virtual Machines (Zones): A light-weight virtualization solution offering a complete and secure userland environment on a single global kernel, offering true bare metal performance and all the features illumos has, namely dynamic introspection via DTrace
- Hardware Virtual Machines (KVM, Bhyve): A full virtualization solution for running a variety of guest OS's including Linux, Windows, *BSD, Plan9 and more

Virtualization in SmartOS builds on top of the foundational illumos technologies inherited from OpenSolaris, namely:

- ZFS for storage virtualization
- Crossbow (dladm) for network virtualization
- Zones for virtualization and containment
- DTrace for introspection
- SMF for service management

                <abstract>Meta-Press.es is a WebExtention to help you exploring the online press, with no middlemen between the newspapers and your web browser. It allows you to discover millions of results within seconds and lists the last ones of each sources. Searches can be scheduled and results can be selected and exported.</abstract>
                <description>Meta-Press.es is a free software project built as a decentralized alternative to Google News. It is developed by Simon Descarpentries, ex-member of La Quadrature du Net, treasurer of the Fund for Defense of Net Neutrality FDN2.org and web artisan with 20 years of experience.

Meta-Press.es runs entirely from your web browser and requires nothing else than online newspapers with internal search features to run. It supports currently more than 500 sources (newspapers, scientific press, online agendas…) but everything is made to help users contributing more sources.

Using Meta-Press.es, there is no data sent to third parties (including our servers). We're not asking the users to believe us about the respect of their privacy, it's a matter of verifiable fact. No Meta-Press.es servers also means that Meta-Press.es is not a single point of failure, surveillance or censorship, like GAFAM are. 

Meta-Press.es helps you evading the swamp of third-party trackers and it works great from a Tor Browser.</description>

                <abstract>We will take a cursory look at the protocols that underpin audio over IP from studios to stages and on to broadcast. Focusing on AES67 the you will gain a basic understanding of what it is, how it works and how it is inherently vulnerable to attack. At a high level this talk should be accessible and entertaining to all, although to grasp the more nuanced details a rudimentary knowledge of IP networking and audio digitisation will be helpful.</abstract>
                <description>Description:

In the professional audio space the heavy and expensive XLR snakes of old have largely been replaced with audio over IP. Operationally this move to audio over IP has provided many benefits, such as being able to use the same equipment for audio as they use for video and lighting rather than special sets of gear for each aspect of a production. However with the increased use of commodity IT hardware in this operational technology (OT) environment comes an increase in attack surface from more software, easier access and less segmentation. As with many places where IT components get re-purposed for OT the administration practices and development practices of the vendors haven’t necessarily caught up with the with the best practices of there IT counterparts. There are some hard problems to solve for audio over IP such as multicast encryption and authentication but also much simpler but more cultural things like updating a working system. 

It is hoped that by presenting this topic to the broader community of hackers that more talented people get interested in the hard bits, and perhaps we can even reach the folks on the operational technology side to see what measures can be taken to improve the security of existing systems.</description>

                <abstract>drand is an opensource project allowing anybody to run a “randomness beacon”. Its goal? Providing a trustable, verifiable source of public randomness that would enable full transparency in online lotteries, leader election or blockchain smart contracts.
This talk is about what distributed randomness is, what it means for developers, and users, and why you’d want to use it. I will also present to you the current ecosystem around drand, and what it enables you to do differently and why it is desirable in a distributed, decentralized web to have public, verifiable randomness.

Don’t worry though: we will first go through an easy overview of how it works without diving too much into the gory cryptographic details. In addition, I’ll demo how drand works in practice, and explain you how you can easily use it in your applications since drand nodes can be queried by anybody.

Disclaimer: this is NOT a blockchain talk, but rather a distributed system one.</abstract>
                <description>[drand](https://drand.love/) (pronounced "dee-rand") is a distributed randomness beacon daemon written in Golang.
It has been used by Cloudflare, EPFL, Kudelski Security, UCL and other partners to setup a distributed randomness project that was unveiled in June 2019: the ["League of Entropy"](https://blog.cloudflare.com/league-of-entropy). Since then even more members have joined the league.

Servers running drand can be linked with each other to produce collective, publicly verifiable, unbiasable, unpredictable random values at fixed intervals using bilinear pairings and threshold cryptography. Drand nodes can also serve locally-generated private randomness to clients.

Generating public randomness is the primary functionality of drand.
Public randomness is generated collectively by drand nodes and publicly available. The main challenge in generating good randomness is that no party involved in the randomness generation process should be able to predict or bias the final output. Additionally, the final result has to be third-party verifiable to make it actually useful for applications like lotteries, sharding, or even "nothing up my sleeves" parameter generation for security protocols.

drand relies on the following cryptographic constructions:
  - Pairing-based cryptography and Barreto-Naehrig curves.
  - Pedersen's distributed key generation protocol for the setup.
  - Threshold BLS signatures for the generation of public randomness.
  - ECIES for the encryption of private randomness.

These are well known, while still relatively cutting edge cryptographic schemes.

Why do we need such randomness?
A lot of reasons actually:
 - Lotteries, jury selection, election event, random sampling for audits, ...
 - Protocols &amp; cryptography:
	- Verifiable gossip: randomly choosing peers in a verifiable way in a network to disseminate information
	- Parameters: Nonces &amp; IV for symmetric encryptions, composite or prime numbers for selecting a field for RSA, or even ECC
	- Schemes: Diffie Hellman exchange, Schnorr signatures, more generally for zero knowledge proofs,
	- Protocols: Tor (e.g. path selection), sharding (Omniledger), leader election for consensus
 - Statistics:  verifiable random sampling, reducing bias e.g. in controlled trials in medicine, etc.

Now, drand is a software ran by a set of independent nodes that collectively produce randomness and whose long term goal is to implement Randomness-as-a-Service:
 - Fetching randomness should be as simple as fetching time from NTP servers.
 - Nodes can serve both private randomness and public randomness:
	- Unpredictable and bias-resistant
	- Publicly Verifiable
 - Decentralized service using threshold cryptography, with high availablity, reliability and trust.

This talk will NOT be about just the cryptography behind drand, but I will cover some of the basics in a simple way in order to tease the people that could be interested, while introducing cool cryptographic constructions to the rest. It will NOT be about how drand is built, but it will really be about the **practical use-cases for drand**, how to use it, its kind of randomness, what it means and why you might want to use it.</description>

                <abstract>Mechanical locks are everywhere and come in all shapes and flavors. But choosing the right lock can be rather difficult. For example, what is better? A lock that is hard to pick, or a lock with hard to duplicate keys. This talk will not give you the answers, but it will help you understand the trade-offs. Furthermore, we will have fun threat modeling our locks.</abstract>
                <description>Is lockpicking a threat you should be concerned about, or is the brick the tool you should care for? Jan-Willem, from The Open Organization of Lockpickers (Toool), will share his ideas on mechanical security and threat modeling. We will make it fun and use several case studies, starting with defining a lock, threat modeling mechanical puzzles, and use several case studies where the threat was overrated. Simply put, attacks against locks range from the trivial to mastery. I'll share multiple failed attempts of attacks that should be trivial, but were not in practice, and we will analyze them together.</description>

                <abstract>Only three years ago you wouldn't have had a chance to get this so-called reality past any decent editor. Now, plotting a book or movie has become increasingly hard and the next years in publishing will be interesting, since our standards in what is scary or believable or how dumb can one be to do XY as a book character, to get into whatever problems, have tremendously changed.</abstract>
                <description>I'm an author, writing crime novels and scifi and during the last three years, some collegues and I have often said the phrase "if this was a book, you wouldn't get that past an editor". But it seems, our standards on what is real, believable or doable have changed somewhat over the pandemic. This does not only afflict society itself (fake news, mobs, conspiracy myths etc.), but also (pop) culture and the its creators like authors of books or movie scripts. I have no forecast, on where we might end up or if movies and books will return to story worlds of our old believes, but I can share musings about society, tech and humanity's deepest desire in stories and authors who have to face a different kind of basic understanding of the world to start from when writing stories.</description>

                <abstract>The use of data is accelerating, not only owing to increasing technical possibilities like AI and earth observation, but also as a result of crises such as COVID-19 and climate change which accelerate the deployment of data and technology. This is happening on a small and local scale, as well as on a large and global one. Precisely because these data are potentially personal, and its use is becoming commonplace, it is urgent to internalize shared principles for the responsible use of data to achieve greater common value, better data and better products. These are preferably intrinsic principles that guarantee the safety and privacy of people, our social values and human dignity. In this talk we discuss an ethical framework for the use of location data. Together with the crowd we will investigate several dilemma's in which location data play an important role. How far can you go? Which values are more important? These are the kind of questions we will present and discuss.</abstract>
                <description>The ethical framework is designed for the use of (personal) location data.

How do we ensure that the technology we develop is at the service of society? How do we respect shared public values and the individual rights when developing applications made possible by location data? With the discussions that have erupted around apps for monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that the answers to these questions are not crystal clear.

The purpose of the ethical reference is to inspire data users, but also policy makers and decision makers to help them collect, use and apply personal location data responsibly. Location data are all data that show where people are located and how they move, whether or not they can be traced. This data can, for example, be collected via mobile apps.

In this talk we discuss the different values that are conflicting in the use of location data. We present several dilemma's and cases and will involve the public actively in discussing these dilemma's.

                <abstract>The web is a mess, bloated with data-gathering trackers, predatory UX, massive resource loads, and it is absorbing everything it touches. The Small Internet is a counter-cultural movement to wrangle things back under control via minimalism, hands-on participation, and good old fashioned conversation. At its heart are technologies like the venerable Gopher protocol or the new Gemini protocol offering a refuge and a place to dream of a better future.</abstract>
                <description>Join me and be reintroduced to Gopher in 2021 and learn what this old friend has to offer us in a world full of web services and advertising bombardment. We will also explore the new Gemini protocol and how it differs from Gopher and HTTP.

We will explore the protocols themselves, their history, and what the modern ecosystems are like. I will briefly review the technical details of implementing servers or clients of your own, and how to author content as a user. Discussion will cover limitations, grey-areas, and trade-offs in exchange for speed and simplicity.

Through these alternative protocols we'll see the small internet in action.</description>

                <abstract>One of the most used video entry systems is analysed for this talk. Severe security implications that range from passive, information gathering, attacks to active attacks where unauthorised access to buildings can be gained.
During the talk the technical details of the bus system will be discussed and multiple attackvectors will be demonstrated. At the end of the talk the disclosure procedure to high value targets and the manufacturer are also discussed.</abstract>
                <description>Feeling safe at home and at work is one of the most basic requirements for living. Part of being, and feeling, safe is the physical access system of the building.
For this talk the video intercom system designed and manufactured by one of the most used brands in building access control and video entry technology is… evaluated.
In order to paint a picture of the magnitude of the security implications it is good to mention that this system is not just used in apartment buildings but also in government offices such as the probation office in The Netherlands.

The talk will discuss the technical aspects of the bus system and how and why this has major security implications. Not only passive attacks will be shown but also more active attacks that can compromise physical security in the buildings where the system is used.

The talk will also include how disclosure to some potential targets was done. The reaction from the manufacturer will also be discussed in the talk.</description>

                <abstract>The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability disclosure goes international. We’re building a community of enthusiasts to help stop the downward spiral of the internet, we’re calling it CSIRT.global. It’s aimed at international collaboration. Trust and communication, balanced with a sense of reality about the sensitive information we deal with, are key. Here’s how you can help, one vulnerability at a time.</abstract>
                <description>The internet is wonderful. It is also broken and spiralling downward. Governments and big tech often don’t serve the interests of internet enthusiasts. Some people decided to “be the change”. In 2019, The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability was founded, and now it has over 70 volunteers. You have likely heard of our work, like Citrix and Kaseya. Communication is key in disclosing and informing organizations. Internationally, this can pose a real challenge. Therefore, we are building an international community, and we’re calling it CSIRT.global. Trust and communication are key. In this talk, you will learn why we’re expanding, what our challenges are, how we deal with sensitive information, and why it’s logical a volunteer organisation takes the lead. Finally, you’ll learn how you can help.</description>

                <abstract>Reproducible Builds is a technique that can be used to secure the software delivery pipeline.

For open source software, they even allow independently auditing published binaries, removing a single point of trust from the distribution process. This can be used by individual projects or even complete Linux distributions.</abstract>
                <description>The software delivery pipeline is an increasingly popular attack vector: even when your project source code is known-good (audited), an attacker can inject malware by gaining access to the machine used to build (and sign) the binaries.

Reproducible Builds provides a mechanism to counter such attacks: by building the same source code on independently-administered machines and comparing their outcome.

Several Linux distributions (Debian, Arch, openSUSE, NixOS, OpenWrt, ...) are working towards using Reproducible Builds to make their binary packages independently verifiable, but also individual projects use it to verify their deliverables. This talk will give an overview of progress, results and next steps.</description>

                <abstract>This workshop is the hands-on version of the talk we will give on Saturday. We will shorty look at the research we are doing at Greenpeace on digital disobedience actions. Also we will introduce the 4 different action tactics we work with at Greenpeace, Direct Action, Mass Protest, Direct Communication and Photo Opportunity and use these as a basis to come up with digital actions.

The workshop and working in your group consists of two parts: 
Part1: Brainstorm. Try to translate your action tactic to the digital domain.
Part2: pick the best action you designed and check if it is actually doable/feasible.
Final: present it to the whole group

We have identified two potential targets that Greenpeace is working on.... Who will that be? ;)</abstract>
                <description>Greenpeace is a direct action organization. We have been doing direct civil disobedient actions for 50 years now. At Greenpeace we know our strength and our weaknesses when doing actions in physical spaces. We scale buildings and hang banners, we have blocked the petrol harbour in Rotterdam (multiple times) and we stop oil/gas rigs from operating. All these kinds of actions are part of a struggle for a healthy climate and safe planet to live on and so ideologically motivated. 

The right to protest is a fundamental European right, a right that is very dear to us and important when chased by the law. At Greenpeace we always look at new ways to do disobedient actions. This is why we started a research on how online actions can contribute to campaigns. The last few months we have been looking into the possibilities of digital civil disobedience actions. We looked at the risks, the actions and the possibilities it will bring. One thing we learned is that everyone we talk to about this topic is super excited.</description>

                <abstract>Transforming the boring parts of web application testing with automation, scalability and a lot of requests: How to automate flagging the potentially vulnerable components and web application parts? Making the tooling work for you and not vice versa? Want to figure out how to build a simple DAST testing case for your application or interested to see how to go from few lines of shellscript or Python to a fully fledged bug bounty hunting automation? Let's make it happen!</abstract>
                <description>In this workshop the participants will discover new tools and learn new techniques for building automation tasks to find web application vulnerabilities. The workshop revolves around typical vulnerability classes, and explores the requirements to find and validate vulnerabilities using automation. 

Participants are provided with a virtual test environment with existing vulnerabilities to fine tune their workflows and to discover more efficient ways to find their way around the web application jungle.

This event is suitable for beginners as well as more advanced web application hackers, system administrators and developers alike. 

Minimum requirements to get the best out of this workshop: 
 - Laptop with Linux based operating system or a Linux VM
 - Basic knowledge of *NIX command line</description>

                <abstract>At its core, systemd is a "system and service manager -
an init system used to bootstrap user space and manage user processes.
It also provides replacements for various daemons and utilities,
including device management, login management, network connection management,
and event logging"
for Linux operating systems. (Wikipedia)

Or, to take it more wildly:
"systemd takes all the init features formerly implemented
with sticky tape, shell script hacks, and the sweat of administrators
and formalizes them in a unified field theory of how services
should be configured, accessed, and managed."

Let me help you to survive.</abstract>
                <description>At its core, systemd is a "system and service manager -
an init system used to bootstrap user space and manage user processes.
It also provides replacements for various daemons and utilities,
including device management, login management, network connection management,
and event logging"
for Linux operating systems. (Wikipedia)

Systemd is in use in most distributions,
so, when using Linux, you presumably do not have a choice like 'take it or leave it'.
You can't avoid it.
You just have to bite the bullet.

This talk is also aimed at diehards, to whom I say:
"Ignore the controversy for a bit and
give systemd a chance to win your love"

Let me assist you.

I was asked to make this presentation in 2020 because ... no such thing was available.
When looking at the courses conducted by a Dutch UNIX/Linux training company,
I must say: they tell you about systemd,
but the details are somewhat scattered among their sysadmin training courses.
Nowadays YMMV.

So I happily started making the presentation and used this for the introduction:
"systemd takes all the init features formerly implemented
with sticky tape, shell script hacks, and the sweat of administrators
and formalizes them in a unified field theory of how services
should be configured, accessed, and managed."

The presentation is interspersed with hands on parts, in which I use many examples
to give you an idea of how to use those hundreds of commands and thousands of options.
I also found a way to circumvent typing errors.</description>

                <abstract>Are you interested in maps? Are you searching for a FLOSS mapping navigation? Do you need geodata? Do you need a map on your site? Do you want to help creating maps from your local environment or from vulnerable places? Then, you have come to the right talk! This talks gives a broad overview of OpenStreetMap, the community and how to get started with it.</abstract>
                <description>Note: 1st session is in Dutch, the 2nd session is in English

OpenStreetMap is an open database of geodata and has become the biggest geodataset of the world. It is often called 'the wikipedia of maps' and is getting used in more and more applications - from grassroot movements to big corporations. But it can be confusing to dive into the ecosystem.

In this talk, I'll give a high-level overview of OpenStreetMap and answer the most important questions:

- What is OpenStreetMap (and what is it not?)
- What applications exist?
- What tools exist?
- How can one contriute?
- How can one export data?
- How can one get in touch with the local mapping community?

No previous experience with mapping or GIS needed! This is a talk, so you don't have to bring anything. However, if you need some help with your first OSM-edits, I'll stick around after the talk to get you started. In that case, it might be useful to bring your laptop (or smartphone)</description>

                <abstract>Let us have a discussion about what bad communication is and how to avoid it in the future - especially when you interact with others. 
There are five common patterns we fall into, when we are communicating badly. This workshop will give you the tools to recognise these anti-patterns in yourself and others and furthermore the knowledge on how to change your communication for the better in the future. This will support you in getting your message understood.</abstract>
                <description>Have you ever been in a situation where your communication went all wrong? When an open conversation turned into an argument that left you wondering "Why did this happen?" 

This happens to all of us. Having an understanding about the five most common roles and anti-patterns of bad communication, can help prevent them from happening. Or help you to get out of them. 

Understanding of these roles also helps you to create space for good communication – I.e., what to do and say, when you discover that your conversation partner acts accordingly to one of the anti-patterns.

This workshop will explain these roles and anti-patterns, discovering the signs, the reasons behind them, and what to focus on in order to avoid them. It will focus on spoken communication, not on other aspects like body language, facial expression or context and setting.

The workshop is a mixture presentation, group chat and self-reflection.

About me

                <abstract>Observing and measuring Internet traffic can tell us a lot about the health and resiliency of Internet locally, regionally and globally. There is a constant increase in global political and social instability which often leads to Internet shutdowns or disruptions. We at the NCC are looking into improving our internet measurement tools so that they can be used to detect, analyze and document these events.</abstract>
                <description>RIPE Atlas is a network of 11000+ globally distributed probes that perform active internet measurements 24/7. It is a community project, data gathered by built-in measurements is open to everyone. Customized measurements could be public or private, as per decision of measurement owner.

If there is a suspected internet shutdown, we might get an insight into what kind of shutdown we're seeing, how the traffic is flowing in and out of the country/region thanks to a high number of vantage points and ability to run custom measurements towards key elements of internet infrastructure (like root DNS servers). We built various tools on top of Atlas, for example IPmap which might also be helpful to visualize traffic flows. Routing Information Service (RIS) - platform for collecting and storing Internet routing data - is another useful NCC tool.

We used Atlas and RIS data to look into resiliency of Ukrainian Internet (https://labs.ripe.net/author/emileaben/the-resilience-of-the-internet-in-ukraine) and how conflict/sanctions affected Russian networks (https://labs.ripe.net/author/emileaben/how-is-russia-connected-to-the-wider-internet).

We are choosing a workshop format because we want to collect feedback from both technical and not-strictly technical people on how to improve our platform and to learn which features might be missing.</description>

                <description>You know the impressive visuals from TV series and movies. The hacker opens a black console window, types fast on the keyboard and suddenly has root on the target system, saving the day. But how does this look like in reality?

If you drop by with a Laptop running "Kali Linux" either from USB-Stick or from within a virtual machine, I will walk you through the necessary steps. From analysing the target system, finding exploits, on to successfully hacking the "victim" using metasploit. And if you are quick enough and behave, we might even get so far as to remotely crashing the system.

This is an introductory level workshop targeted at a novice/beginner level audience that wants to learn how "hacking" actually works. InfoSec personnel and other "professionals" attending this session will get shanghaied into supporting the other attendees. 

Prerequisites: Bring your own/a Laptop running a recent version of Kali-Linux inside a virtual machine or from a USB stick.</description>

                <abstract>Participants will learn the complete workflow of creating a circuit board with KiCad. At the end of the workshop, you will have a designed PCB that blinks some LEDs and is ready for manufacturing. No prior experience is required, basic electronics knowledge is useful.</abstract>
                <description>**Important**: You need to bring a Notebook with KiCad 6.x including the symbol- and footprint libraries installed. It does not matter which OS. If possible, bring a mouse with a scroll-wheel.

The workshop will have a 10-15minutes lecture part in the beginning where the whole process is demonstrated. You won't need to take notes, a cheat-sheet with the process-steps and the most important shortcuts will be provided.
After the introduction you will draw a simple circuit that blinks two LEDs. Create the layout for it and export manufacturing data. Experienced KiCad users will be around the whole time to answer questions and 

People who know KiCad already are welcome as well. For discussion as well as additional help. 

You can get KiCad at https://www.kicad.org/ (**don't'** use kicad-pcb.org). Most linux distributions will also have a packaged version, make sure to also install the symbol and footprint libraries.</description>

                <abstract>In this workshop, we will learn how to assemble tiny parts on circuit boards by building an electronic touch-activated purring kitten. Anyone can do it. Yes, even you who never touched anything electronic before. Takes 120mins, 20€/kit, avoid caffeine immediately before. Max 10 participants per session, sign up on PAPER at the Hardware Hacking Area.</abstract>
                <description>Takes about two hours. Basic workshop. No prior knowledge needed. Materials cost 20€ per kit.

We are going to build an electronic kitten using tiny tiny SMD parts. It will purr when you touch it right and hiss when you touch it wrong. It's going to work. You will learn how to make your hands not shake at all ever. You will learn how to activate your builtin precision positioning superpowers.

For people afraid of surface mount assembly/rework. You know those tiny little components in modern electronic devices? It's both possible and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you how!

Think you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s? Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is minimal and you probably already have it. We'll learn the answer to THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no longer need to be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before the workshop, because shaky hands are a disadvantage.

The workshop kit costs 20€. Please SIGN UP ON THE PAPER LIST at the Hardware Hacking Area. PLEASE BE ON TIME!</description>

                <abstract>Smart lights have become pervasive in many homes, but they are often designed in such a way that makes them completely reliant on the manufacturer's servers and connectivity to the Internet. However, we would much rather be fully in control of our own devices.

As a target, we took on the cheap and popular Tuya white-label smart lights, which can be commonly found under many different brand names.

In this talk, we'll take you on a trip through our 1-year journey of hacking these devices, including the details of finding and remotely exploiting a vulnerability in the firmware for devices based on the custom BK7231 SoC.</abstract>
                <description>Smart lights have become pervasive in many homes, but they are often designed in such a way that makes them completely reliant on the manufacturer's servers and connectivity to the Internet. However, for people who want full control of their own devices, there weren't many affordable and easily usable options. 

One such option became available near the end of 2018 when a vulnerability was discovered in the firmware of smart devices manufactured by Tuya Smart. Shortly after the discovery of said vulnerability, a project by the name of tuya-convert popped up. It allowed its users to remotely flash Tuya devices with custom firmware by exploiting the - at the time - new vulnerability.

By 2020, however, tuya-convert stopped working for an increasing number of new devices. The manufacturer had patched the vulnerability, and unexploitable devices have begun showing up on the market. That's when we decided to look for the next vulnerability for Tuya's smart devices in order to allow remote custom firmware flashing once more.

We spent some time hacking on early devices which were based on the ESP8266 platform, and a while later switched to the newer devices based on the custom BK7231 SoC. During the course of our research, we found issues in firmware on both platforms and rediscovered some helpful reversing techniques.

In this talk, we'll cover our research journey with its ups and downs on both platforms, as well as the details of a memory corruption vulnerability which we exploited on the BK7231-based devices.</description>

                <description>A demonstration of the power of MQTT in combination with Node-RED. We'll also take a look at the "universal" Tasmota firmware for ESP8266 and ESP32-based devices. This all to hopefully make you enthusiastic to start building your own projects with these building blocks. 
MQTT is a very light message transport mechanism that uses a standard network connection and a subscribe-publish 
protocol to get messages from one device to one or more others in the network in a structured manner.
Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services very suited for working with MQTT messages.
Tasmota started as a universal firmware for ESP8266/8285 IoT-devices, now with added support for the ESP32 and it comes with MQTT-support out of the box.
With these tools, a raspberry pi and a few lines of script, we can start building home automation or whatever you want.</description>

                <abstract>A lack of VoLTE standardisation breaks voice calling globally. Your brand new smartphone may not work because VoLTE is screwed up by manufacturers and carriers.
Voice-over-LTE (4G), voice-over-NR (5G) and voice-over-WiFi have been standardized for years, but now that more and more 2G and 3G networks are shut down by operators, users discover their phones don't work anymore with basic voice calling. The cause is a massive mess in standardization, with a boatload of options and settings and vendors and carriers interpreting it differently, masked by fall-back to 2G and 3G and lack of "international roaming" agreements for VoLTE. 
Handset manufacturers decided to implement shortcuts (neglecting parts of the standards) or even worse, implementing white-lists with only mayor operators included, so you cannot switch operators anymore and are up for a big surprise while roaming in another country.
The result: Even your brand new phone might be unable to provide voice calling in one country but work in another. Voice-calling might work if you're lucky, but you cannot reach 112/911, the eCALL system in your car fails after 2G/3G shutdown or you cannot receive an SMS you need for remote Two-Factor-Authentication while roaming in another country. 
It's such a disastrous mess, so should we stop the 2G/3G shutdown and get-it-fixed?</abstract>
                <description>This is a tale of a disaster still looming in most of Europe for Europeans, as 2G/3G still works as the fall-back mode of your device. As a result nobody noticed that VoLTE was screwed up.
However many non-Americans roaming with their phones into the USA suddenly learn their brand new phone isn't working for voice-calls, as AT&amp;T has shut down 2G/3G on July 1st 2022. 
Problems already did happen to users roaming into countries like India.
Users who buy seemingly the same recent model of a supplier like Samsung or Apple, and think they are safe, might be up for a big suprise too. Months of testing needed per device was considered way too cumbersome and too expensive by many, so at best it was halfway done. 
Manufacturers decided to cope with it by curtailing the myriad of options and settings, included mobile-network-code white-lists or implement short-cuts (neglecting parts of the standards). 
With white-lists you suddenly are tied to an operator and changing your subscription from a major Mobile Network Operator to an MVNO, makes voice-calling on your brand new smartphone defunct, only allowing data communications working.
The "advice" to complainers is just to use voice-apps, but these don't allow Emergency calls.
eCALL devices built into cars that dial emergency numbers may work in your home country, but fail when driving in another land on your holiday.
Roaming agreements between international carriers have up to now been made only between major operators in large countries, There are merely 50 international VoLTE roaming agreements actually working. If you are from a "small country" like Sweden, you're out of luck in the USA.
Voice-over-LTE (4G), voice-over-NR (5G) and voice-over-WiFi have been screwed up by an unholy alliance of handset manufacturers, carriers, the GSM-Association and IMS-core vendors and standardization bodies, who couldn't decide to settle VoLTE down to a limited set of options and prescribe large scale compulsory plugfests and compatibility tests.
Regulators have looked away, expecting the "magic of the market would resolve all issues".
Some vendors have engaged in favoritism with white-listing or don't deal with MVNOs and MVNEs, as they don't order millions of devices.
This talk explains the cause of the mess and highlights the problems lurking in your brand new device.
It provides real problems, with devices and disfunctional VoLTE, collected in 2021/2022.
We should ask the question whether the announced shutdowns of 2G/3G in most of Europe have to be stopped. Must device manufacturers and carriers be forced to clean-up their act now, and halt their anti-competitive practices and favoritism, before people die as they cannot reach 112/911 during an Emergency?</description>

                <description>Bodging badges in a time where the pandemic and the chip shortage makes creating a cool gadget near impossible. This talk explains how we pulled off our most advanced creation yet (or not, depending on how things go...). We will tell you about the process of converting a vague idea into a piece of electronics, including the prototyping process and the difficulties we encountered.</description>

                <abstract>The traditional talk by most or all operational teams about the infrastructure built for MCH2022. While the site has some infrastructure in place, a lot of it has to be built for this event. On the other hand there's also teams that just make things go away.</abstract>
                <description>MCH2022 can not be organised without a lot of temporary infrastructure. Join the operational teams and discover the new, the unexpected or the surprising technologies that were necessary to make MCH2022 a success. Expect graphs, pictures of bodges, perhaps a few hacks but definitely a lot of hard work behind the scenes. Think fiber, LEDs, DatenKlos, trusses, waste bags, Terabytes, angels, vouchers, simultaneous viewers, amps, volts, golf carts etc. Please smile (or laugh) at our bad jokes, we're all running on fumes and in desperate need of a proper sleep.</description>

                <abstract>Open source code makes up 90% of most codebases. How do you know if you can trust your open source dependencies? Do you know what’s really going on in your node_modules folder? It is critical to manage your dependencies effectively to reduce risk but most teams have an ad-hoc process where any developer can introduce dependencies. Software supply chain attacks have exploded over the past 12 months and they’re only accelerating in 2022. We’ll dive into examples of recent supply chain attacks targeting the JavaScript, Node.js, and npm ecosystems, as well as concrete steps you can take to protect your apps, projects, and teams from this emerging threat.</abstract>

Do you know what’s really going on in your node_modules folder? It is critical to manage your dependencies effectively to reduce risk but most teams have an ad-hoc process where any developer can introduce dependencies. Software supply chain attacks have exploded over the past 12 months and they’re only accelerating in 2022. We’ll dive into examples of recent supply chain attacks targeting the Node.js, JavaScript, and npm ecosystems, as well as concrete steps you can take to protect your apps, projects, and teams from this emerging threat.

Takeaways for this talk:

1. Understand the scope of the supply chain threats against the open source ecosystem, specifically with a focus on JavaScript, Node.js, and npm.

2. Review of our work to audit every open source package on npm to detect the following types of attacks: malware, typo-squats, hidden code, misleading packages, permission creep

3. Specific examples and code walk-throughs of actual malware that was found on npm

4. Discussion of existing methods and tools for detecting supply chain attacks against open source, including limitations

5. Introduction of new open source tool which helps detect supply chain attacks in real-time</description>

                <abstract>Since early 2021, it has been impossible to buy most integrated circuits and various other components. I'll explain how and why this happened, why it's going to keep happening, and where the fragility of the electronics manufacturing ecosystem comes from.</abstract>
                <description>A terrible miscalculation by one unrelated industry (car manufacturing) caused the entire electronics market to fall apart in a spectacular way, meaning that for over a year now it's been impossible to buy many important electronic components, including most ICs. I'll talk about how the electronics component ecosystem is structured, why it's inherently fragile, and how everyone acting in their own best interest has made the problem worse. I'll also share some stories about working around supply issues at various companies and projects I've been involved with during this period.

Come hear a fireside chat about how car companies are trash, how you can build a world economy on shortsightedness, and how two conference calls can bring down the entire world's supply of essential parts.</description>

                <abstract>HowNormalAmI.eu is an interactive documentary that showcases how algorithms judge your beauty, age, gender, weight, life expectancy and emotions by simply looking at your face. The project not only shows how face recognition technology is entering our everyday lives, but it lets you experience these judgements yourself in a safe and privacy friendly way.

This talk will zoom in on one algorithm that tries to deduce your Body Mass Index (BMI). The 'making of' will discuss the ethical questions it raised, the dubious science behind it, the dodgy data sources, and the surprising companies that are playing around with this technology.</abstract>
                <description>HowNormalAmI.eu is an interactive documentary that showcases how algorithms judge your beauty, age, gender, weight, life expectancy and emotions by simply looking at your face. The project not only shows how face recognition technology is entering our everyday lives, but it lets you experience these judgements yourself in a safe and privacy friendly way.

Dutch artist Tijmen Schep has created this interactive experience to reveal how we are increasingly being judged on our face. For example, dating websites like Tinder uses beauty scoring algorithms to match people who are about equally attractive. Services like HireVue claims to find the optimal job applicants based on their 'micro expressions'.

This talk will zoom in on one algorithm that tries to deduce your Body Mass Index (BMI) from your face. The 'making of' will discuss the ethical questions it raised, the dubious science behind it, the dodgy data sources, and the surprising companies that are playing around with this technology.

Since its launch in september of 2020 the project has been viewed over 185.000 times. If you want to find out if you're more attractive than the Spice girls, make sure you visit www.hownormalami.eu</description>

                <abstract>In 2017 (just before SHA2017) the Dutch healthcare sector came together to create Stichting Z-CERT, the Zorg Computer Emergency Response Team. A nonprofit to protect and advise the Dutch Healthcare sector. What started as a small startup has now grown into a scaleup with the ambitions to match. 
The COVID-19 pandemic restarted the discussion about whether or not healthcare is vital infrastructure. With NIS2 the role and importance of Z-CERT will only grow from here on. 
This talk is not to intended to be a corporate “Look how great we are and what kind of sexy products we have. BUY OUR STUFF.” No, we want to simply show what we do and what we learned in 5 years of being a CERT. This might help our (future) fellow CERT’s and the community.</abstract>
                <description>This talk is not to intended to be a corporate “Look how great we are and what kind of sexy products we have. BUY OUR STUFF.” No, we want to simply show what we do and what we learned in 5 years of being a CERT. These lessons include:
- how to startup a sectoral CERT
- How to build a community of members of your constituency
- Connecting with fellow CERT organizations
- Tools of the trade
This might help our (future) fellow CERT’s and the community.</description>

                <abstract>The whole world depends on Global Navigation Satellite Systems like GPS, Galileo, BeiDou and GLONASS. The technology behind these systems is fascinating and far more interested than generally presented. Although GNSS is super important, up to recently no good monitoring was publicly available. The "galmon.eu" project changed this.

In this talk I cover:

  * How your phone really figures out where it is (so it can sell more expensive ads)
    * How the "satellite ephemeris" is broadcast, what it means
  * What is really in this 'assisted GPS'?
  * The extensive ground infrastructure that is active 24/7 to determine the satellite orbits so GNSS is precise enough to tell which store you are in, or which side of the road you are driving on
  * How GNSS are monitored in public by 100 Galmon.eu volunteers, running open source receivers all over the world
     * And the research we enable
  * Discussion of suitable hardware and GNSS-SDR that allows hackers to see each and every bit coming from the satellites
  * A brief part on how GNSS can be spoofed and jammed, and the odd cryptography used to help detect or prevent this

The goal of this presentation is to expose the fascinating reality behind that little circle on your maps app, but also to explain how vulnerable this system is, which is why we need to monitor it closely.</abstract>

                <abstract>Sensor.Community - Global platform for Open Environmental Data

We invite you to become part of Sensor.Community. The worldwide largest Air Quality sensor network run by contributors generating Open Data. Build a sensor, collect Open Data, share it in a continuous stream with the global network and join forces in local Sensor.Community groups.</abstract>
                <description>Sensor.Community is the global platform for environmental open data.

We provide the software and assembly guide for the DIY sensor kits for citizen empowerment.

Mission Statement:
Sensor.Community is a contributors driven global sensor network that creates Open Environmental Data.

Our mission is to inspire and enrich people’s lives by offering a platform for the collective curiosity in nature that is genuine, joyful and positive.

Sensor.Community started 2015 in Stuttgart / South Germany as a local project. The goal then was the deployment of 300 low cost Air-Quality sensors in Stuttgart. These devices should be easy to build for everyone. Until now the platform has grown to more than 14.000 sensors in over 70 countries (January 2022).

These sensors are measuring environmental data as Air-Quality, temperature, pressure and relative humidity. You can see the live values on the live map at Maps.Sensor.Community. Everything ever measured is available as Open Environmental Data. You can download all historical Open Data.

To participate you can join a local group which you can discover on the community layer of the map where live values are displayed. -&gt; https://maps.sensor.community/#2/0.0/0.0

We invite you to become part of the community. Build a sensor, generate Open Data, share it in a continuous stream with the network and join forces in local Sensor.Community groups to analyse it. Find like-minded people which care about the environment and the implications on our health. Stay informed and exchange with your neighbours.

Once the sensor tube is connected to the network its measured values are available live on the map at Sensor.Community. These values are refreshed every 2 ½ minutes and enable all citizens to see how the situation is around them.

The available historical Open Data of all ever measured values enable other projects to serve citizens with other specific services and functionality.

Sensor.Community is here to serve citizens on a global layer with environmental Open Data. Our focus is to add further sensor methods, collaborate with institutions as RIVM.nl on data standards and better integrations in their daily work. One great example here is the integration of the Open Data from Sensor.Community into the Data-portal of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands at RIVM.nl</description>

Then come to this session and learn how you can make your life easier and your work more efficient by using custom config files and a tiny little bit of preparation.

In addition, we will also cover common best practices and improvements to your current SSH setup.
You will benefit the most from this talk, if you have used SSH before. SSH novices are welcome as well, SSH experts may drop by for the bad jokes.

The target audience for this talk is people with a beginner/intermediate understanding of SSH.</description>

The capabilities of both generating and collecting data have been increasing rapidly in the last several decades. Everybody needs info / data in life.
Some examples:
In your job to find new businesses opportunity’s or just to "spy" on employees or your competitors? 
Reverse engineering for a simple replay attack, you might need to know the frequency, Chip vendor .or layout
Finding your long lost friends, loves-once from long ago.
Some time's you know it must be out there somewhere but you just can't find it.
Why can't you find it and how to improve your search skills on gathering or collecting data.
Step by step I will guide you in the art off “collecting data”.
And NO is not an option is something I hope to gain.

This is NOT an debate about the ethics or politics of online reconnaissance on personal information gathering.*
Further this is not a guide/training to steal information for criminal purposes.

Description

The name of collecting data in Military terms is Open-source intelligence, often referred to as OSINT. This word OSINT can mean many things to many people.“Officially, it is defined as any data or Intelligence produced from publicly available information that is collected, exploited or disseminated in a manner to an audience in a form of an rapport or spoken word.”
The main word for collection data is OSINT or Open-source intelligence this is just like an treasure chest. 
Mostly It includes lots of "possibly sensitive information".
Sometimes it is publicly available on the internet, and the best of all, it’s “free”.
With some simple tooling you can find more than you aspect.
No need for expensive hardware, all you need is an internet browser and a terminal 
You could do this from you're phone all you need is an terminal and an browser.

                <abstract>In this workshop, we will learn how to assemble tiny parts on circuit boards by building an electronic touch-activated purring kitten. Anyone can do it. Yes, even you who never touched anything electronic before. Takes 120mins, 20€/kit, avoid caffeine immediately before. Max 10 participants per session, sign up on PAPER at the Hardware Hacking Area.</abstract>
                <description>Takes about two hours. Basic workshop. No prior knowledge needed. Materials cost 20€ per kit.

We are going to build an electronic kitten using tiny tiny SMD parts. It will purr when you touch it right and hiss when you touch it wrong. It's going to work. You will learn how to make your hands not shake at all ever. You will learn how to activate your builtin precision positioning superpowers.

For people afraid of surface mount assembly/rework. You know those tiny little components in modern electronic devices? It's both possible and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you how!

Think you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s? Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is minimal and you probably already have it. We'll learn the answer to THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no longer need to be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before the workshop, because shaky hands are a disadvantage.

The workshop kit costs 20€. Please SIGN UP ON THE PAPER LIST at the Hardware Hacking Area. PLEASE BE ON TIME!</description>
